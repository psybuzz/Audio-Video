1
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,199
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,911
I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school.

3
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,290
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,710
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,218
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:40,349
I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,351
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,022
If I could only let her out for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,110
So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,406
But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,242
Not one...

12
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,119
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,539
Who would want to be friends with you?

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,252
I should think you'd be a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,922
We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,216
...even let you have Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,927
...purely out of the goodness of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,596
Not now. It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,100
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,603
Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we?

21
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,730
Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?

22
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,568
In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,655
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...? - I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,740
Excellent.

25
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,122
And you?

26
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:50,085
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,962
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,632
With any luck, this could be the day I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,386
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:15,319
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,118
- Who are you? - Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,204
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,333
...but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,002
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,297
It's just that Dobby has come to tell you...

36
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,302
It is difficult, sir. Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,308
- Why don't you sit down? - Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,024
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,360
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,862
Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir...

41
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,826
...but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,372
You can't have met many decent wizards then.

43
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,999
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,877
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:18,006
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! - Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,549
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,682
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:33,188
- Bad Dobby. - Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,607
Are you all right?

50
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,236
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,614
Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.

52
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,743
- Your family? - The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,913
Dobby is bound to serve one family forever.

54
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,624
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

55
00:04:54,252 --> 00:05:00,048
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,551
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,389
...to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:12,728
There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:16,231
What terrible things? Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,568
Can't say.

61
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,741
- Okay, I understand. You can't say. - Don't make me talk. I-

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,454
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down. - Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,666
So when they arrive at the ninth hole...

64
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,838
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,967
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,139
- Let me go. - Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,352
- What the devil are you doing up here? - I was just-

68
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,271
You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,273
Sorry.

70
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,945
One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,866
- And fix that door. - Yes, sir.

72
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,787
HARRY: See why I've got to go back?

73
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,707
I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:20,504
- It's the only place I've got friends. - Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,632
Well, I expect they've been...

76
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,470
Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,973
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:36,353
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,190
...Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:45,821
- Give me those. Now. - No!

81
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,378
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,884
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,222
Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.

84
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,016
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:21,273
Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,445
VERNON: It spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor.

87
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,572
One plumber said, "Look at all that water. "

88
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,741
The second plumber said, "Yes, and that's just the top of it. "

89
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,499
Mr. Mason...

90
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,547
Vernon tells me that you're a wonderful golfer.

91
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,508
I play. Occasionally.

92
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,343
Hm.

93
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,804
Mrs. Mason...

94
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,557
...where do you get your beautiful suits?

95
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,019
Oh, all of my suits are tailor-made.

96
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,440
VERNON: Dudley...

97
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,235
...wasn't there something you wanted to say?

98
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,991
- Pudding. VERNON: Pudding?

99
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,659
What pudding?

100
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,878
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew. He's very disturbed.

101
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:29,382
Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs.

102
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,263
Well, we have ice cream.

103
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,776
VERNON: You're never going back to that school.

104
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,989
You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!

105
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,287
Hiya, Harry.

106
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:45,834
Ron. Fred. George. What are you all doing here?

107
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,879
Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on, get your trunk.

108
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,305
You better stand back.

109
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,849
Let's go.

110
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,522
- What was that? - What was it?

111
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,027
VERNON: Potter!

112
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,862
DUDLEY: Dad, what's going on?

113
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,158
Go. Go. Go.

114
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,367
DUDLEY: Dad, hurry up.

115
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,413
FRED: Come on. RON: Come on, Harry, hurry up.

116
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,208
Petunia, he's escaping!

117
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,920
RON: I've got you, Harry. - Come here!

118
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,214
HARRY: Let go of me! - No, boy!

119
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,384
You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere.

120
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,178
- Get off! - Drive!

121
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,221
FRED: Right. GEORGE: Right!

122
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,057
VERNON: No! No! No! No!

123
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,229
DUDLEY: Dad!

124
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,865
Damn.

125
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,873
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

126
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,984
FRED: Come on.

127
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,614
Okay, come on. Shh, shh.

128
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,659
Okay, come on.

129
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,919
FRED: Think it'd be all right if we had some?

130
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,963
GEORGE: Yeah, Mum will never know.

131
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,858
It's not much, but it's home.

132
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,318
I think it's brilliant.

133
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,823
Where have you been?

134
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,285
Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear.

135
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,038
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

136
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,208
You could have died. You could have been seen.

137
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,462
Of course, I don't blame you, Harry, dear.

138
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,631
They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window.

139
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,553
Well, you best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley.

140
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,847
Come on, Harry, time for a spot of breakfast.

141
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,809
MRS. WEASLEY: Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

142
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,521
That's it. There we go.

143
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,525
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper? - Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

144
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,819
Hello.

145
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,492
What did I do?

146
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:10,246
Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really.

147
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,041
- Morning, Weasleys. FAMILY: Morning, Dad.

148
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,754
MR. WEASLEY: What a night. Nine raids. - Raids?

149
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,883
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

150
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,386
Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating.

151
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,764
Well, now.

152
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,892
And who are you?

153
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,230
Oh, sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir. Harry Potter.

154
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,525
Good Lord. Are you really?

155
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,404
Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?

156
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,073
This morning.

157
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:50,495
Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.

158
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,082
Did you really? How did it go?

159
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,087
I mean- That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

160
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:04,259
Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles.

161
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,555
Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?

162
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,057
Oh, um...

163
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,895
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

164
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,445
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

165
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,032
- Errol. RON: He's always doing that.

166
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,621
Oh, look, it's our Hogwarts letters. They've sent us Harry's as well.

167
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,833
Dumbledore must know you're here. Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

168
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,960
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, no. - This lot won't come cheap.

169
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,464
- The spell books alone are expensive. MRS. WEASLEY: We'll manage.

170
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:48,469
There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.

171
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,097
Right.

172
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,349
Here we are, Harry. You go first, dear.

173
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,477
But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum.

174
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,687
Floo powder?

175
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:02,150
You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes.

176
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,652
In you go.

177
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,696
That's it.

178
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,951
Diagon Alley.

179
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,461
You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on.

180
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,464
Come on.

181
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,800
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

182
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,387
That's right. Now, take your Floo powder.

183
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,391
That's it, very good.

184
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,896
Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.

185
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,150
Diagonally.

186
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,992
- What did he say, dear? - Diagonally.

187
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,243
I thought he did.

188
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,032
Don't touch anything, Draco.

189
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,410
Yes, Father.

190
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,344
Master Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again.

191
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,890
And young Master Malfoy too. Delighted.

192
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:42,101
I must show you, just in today and very reasonably priced-

193
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,812
I'm not buying today, Borgin, I'm selling.

194
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,398
- Selling? - Draco.

195
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,237
You are aware, no doubt, that the Ministry of Magic...

196
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,491
...is conducting more raids on private houses.

197
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,660
There's even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act.

198
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,415
Pure wizard blood is counting for less everywhere, I'm afraid.

199
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,417
Not with me.

200
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,629
Anyway, I brought a few items from home...

201
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,300
...that might prove, ahem, embarrassing were the Ministry to call.

202
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,386
Just poisons and the like.

203
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,017
Look at that.

204
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,271
That particular item...

205
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,940
...is not for sale.

206
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,025
I understand.

207
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,194
It has unique qualities.

208
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,573
One wouldn't want to see it falling into the wrong hands.

209
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,464
You can keep the box.

210
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,135
What did I say?

211
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,515
Touch nothing.

212
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,268
- Exactly. - Sorry, Father.

213
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,897
Come on, we're going.

214
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,651
It's a pleasure to do business with you, Mr. Malfoy.

215
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,028
Always a pleasure.

216
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,841
Looking for something?

217
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,759
No, I...

218
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,428
I'm just in the wrong place.

219
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,388
Sorry.

220
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,641
Thank you.

221
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:06,537
- Not lost, are you, my dear? - I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

222
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,208
Come with us. We'll help you find your way back.

223
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,295
- No. Please- Hagrid! HAGRID: Harry?

224
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,382
What do you think you're doing down here? Come on.

225
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:29,477
HAGRID: You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

226
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,648
Don't want no one to see you there. People will think you're up to no good.

227
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,025
I was lost, I-

228
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,153
Hang on. What were you doing down there then?

229
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:44,492
Me? I was... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

230
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,536
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

231
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,169
Harry. Hagrid.

232
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,754
Hello, Hermione.

233
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,757
- It's so good to see you. - It's great to see you too.

234
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,010
What did you do to your glasses?

235
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,055
Oculus Reparo.

236
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,269
I definitely need to remember that one.

237
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,190
You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it.

238
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,775
- Okay, bye. - Thank you. Bye.

239
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,944
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

240
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,789
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, Harry.

241
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,209
Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.

242
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,212
MAN 1: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

243
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,673
Here he is.

244
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,262
Mum fancies him.

245
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,724
MAN 2: Make way there, please. Let me by, madam. Thank you.

246
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,310
Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.

247
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,401
It can't be. Harry Potter?

248
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,779
PHOTOGRAPHER: Harry Potter!

249
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,197
Excuse me, madam.

250
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,995
Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page.

251
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,331
Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is.

252
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,918
When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

253
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:22,214
...to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me...

254
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,596
...which, incidentally, is currently celebrating...

255
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,601
...its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

256
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,272
...he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving...

257
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:44,320
...with my entire collected works...

258
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,114
...free of charge.

259
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,535
Now, ladies?

260
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,872
Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed.

261
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,542
All of you wait outside. That's it.

262
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,346
I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?

263
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:15,017
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a bookshop without making the front page.

264
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,353
Leave him alone.

265
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,023
Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend.

266
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,277
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

267
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,862
Mr. Potter.

268
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:33,327
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

269
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,663
Forgive me.

270
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,083
Your scar is legend.

271
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,877
As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.

272
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,380
Voldemort killed my parents.

273
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,927
He was nothing more than a murderer.

274
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,889
You must be very brave to mention his name.

275
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,891
Or very foolish.

276
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,854
Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.

277
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,733
And you must be Miss Granger.

278
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,866
Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents.

279
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,957
Muggles, aren't they?

280
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,048
Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions...

281
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,761
...tatty, secondhand book.

282
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,348
You must be the Weasleys.

283
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,767
It's mad in here. Let's go outside.

284
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,646
LUCIUS: Well, Weasley senior. - Lucius.

285
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:47,568
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?

286
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,070
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

287
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,407
...but judging by the state of this, I'd say not.

288
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,913
What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard...

289
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,165
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

290
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,462
We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

291
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,505
Clearly.

292
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,303
Associating with Muggles.

293
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:23,103
And I thought your family could sink no lower.

294
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,193
I'll see you at work.

295
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,699
See you at school.

296
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,792
MR. WEASLEY: 10:58, come on.

297
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,210
MRS. WEASLEY: The train will leave soon.

298
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,672
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

299
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,929
Okay.

300
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,687
MR. WEASLEY: After you, dear.

301
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,067
MRS. WEASLEY: Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

302
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,570
Let's go.

303
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,629
- What do you two think you're doing? - Sorry.

304
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,091
Lost control of the trolley.

305
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,761
- Why can't we get through? - I don't know.

306
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,265
The gateway has sealed itself for some reason.

307
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,603
The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it.

308
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,107
Harry, if we can't get through...

309
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,110
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

310
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,489
Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.

311
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,867
The car.

312
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,126
There we go.

313
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,838
Now, all we need to do is find the Hogwarts Express.

314
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,591
Ron, are you sure you know how to fly this?

315
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,676
No problem.

316
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,642
Look out!

317
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,728
Aah!

318
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,025
Ron, I should tell you...

319
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,987
...most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.

320
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,280
Right.

321
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,615
Okay.

322
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,177
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty.

323
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,806
Come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train.

324
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,224
Okay.

325
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,195
HARRY: All we need to do is catch up with the train.

326
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,030
We can't be far behind.

327
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,743
- Do you hear that? - We must be getting close.

328
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,329
Hold on.

329
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,774
Harry!

330
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,237
Hold on!

331
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,076
Take my hand!

332
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,582
Hold on!

333
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:15,377
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

334
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,226
- I think we found the train. - Yeah.

335
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,203
Welcome home.

336
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,511
Up! Up!

337
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,640
It's not working!

338
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,146
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

339
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,526
Stop! Stop! Stop!

340
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:49,304
- My wand. Look at my wand. - Be thankful it's not your neck.

341
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,892
- What's happening? - I don't know.

342
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,513
HARRY: Come on, go! Fast!

343
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,633
Scabbers, you're okay.

344
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,220
The car!

345
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:29,488
Dad's gonna kill me.

346
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,415
HARRY: See you, Hedwig.

347
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,086
So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom...

348
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,172
...we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4...

349
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,592
...we almost get killed by a tree...

350
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,304
Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.

351
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,852
Well, take a good look, lads.

352
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,940
This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.

353
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:11,279
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

354
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:17,702
SNAPE: You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.

355
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,956
Do you have any idea how serious this is?

356
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,460
You have risked the exposure of our world.

357
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,047
Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

358
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,426
...that's been on these grounds since before you were born.

359
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,430
Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.

360
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,722
Silence.

361
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:46,148
I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me...

362
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:50,068
...the both of you would be on the train home tonight.

363
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,488
- As it is- DUMBLEDORE: They are not.

364
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,744
Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.

365
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,663
Headmaster...

366
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:06,585
...these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

367
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:10,672
- As such- - I am well aware of our bylaws...

368
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,717
...having written quite a few of them myself.

369
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,345
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

370
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:22,517
...it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.

371
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,103
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

372
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,731
What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?

373
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,108
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

374
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,779
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

375
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,993
...but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done.

376
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:45,123
I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.

377
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,587
DUMBLEDORE: And now I suggest that we all return to the feast.

378
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:55,425
There is a delicious-looking custard tart that I am most anxious to sample.

379
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,443
Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

380
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,269
Morning, everyone.

381
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,480
- Good morning, everyone. - Good morning, Professor Sprout.

382
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,901
SPROUT: Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone.

383
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,904
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

384
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,907
Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root?

385
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,994
Yes, Miss Granger?

386
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,496
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

387
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:11,668
...is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state.

388
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:16,840
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

389
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,843
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

390
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,721
As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings...

391
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:24,764
...their cries won't kill you yet.

392
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,768
But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs...

393
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,437
...for auditory protection.

394
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:35,025
So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly.

395
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,986
Flaps tight down, and watch me closely.

396
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,156
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

397
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,326
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

398
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:50,498
Got it? And...

399
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,834
...now you dunk it down into the other pot...

400
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:57,756
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.

401
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,554
Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.

402
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:09,017
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted. - Yes, well, just leave him there.

403
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,979
Right, on we go. Plenty of pots to go around.

404
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,691
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

405
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:35,418
BOY: There's Nearly Headless Nick. - Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

406
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,171
PERCY: Hello, Sir Nicholas.

407
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,894
Say it. I'm doomed.

408
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,688
- You're doomed. BOY: Hi, Harry.

409
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,610
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

410
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,404
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

411
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,074
Say, do you think your friend here could take a photo of me and you...

412
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,785
...standing together? To prove I've met you.

413
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,121
It's for my dad. He's a milkman, you know.

414
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:13,581
A Muggle, like all our family's been until me.

415
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:17,544
No one knew the stuff I could do was magic till we got letters from Hogwarts.

416
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:20,880
- Everyone just thought I was mental. - Imagine that.

417
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,384
Ron, is that your owl?

418
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,776
Bloody bird's a menace.

419
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,449
Oh, no.

420
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:51,119
Look, everyone. Weasley's got himself a Howler.

421
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:57,792
Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible.

422
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,843
MRS. WEASLEY'S VOICE: Ronald Weasley!

423
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:15,560
How dare you steal that car! I am absolutely disgusted!

424
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,480
Your father's now facing an inquiry at work...

425
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,982
...and it's entirely your fault!

426
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,320
If you put another toe out of line...

427
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,740
...we'll bring you straight home!

428
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,036
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.

429
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,956
Your father and I are so proud.

430
00:39:55,184 --> 00:40:01,606
Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

431
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,358
Me.

432
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,027
Gilderoy Lockhart...

433
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,531
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

434
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,034
...honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League...

435
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,079
...and five times winner...

436
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:22,293
...of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award.

437
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,212
But I don't talk about that.

438
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,883
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him.

439
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,140
I see you've bought a complete set of my books. Well done.

440
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:40,436
Now, I thought we'd start today with a little quiz.

441
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,650
Nothing to worry about.

442
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,445
Just to check how well you've read them.

443
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,197
Thank you.

444
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:55,702
LOCKHART: How much you've taken in.

445
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,210
Look at these questions. They're all about him.

446
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,547
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?"

447
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,719
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?"

448
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,474
You have 30 minutes. Start...

449
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,479
...now!

450
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,487
Tut-tut.

451
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,783
Hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac.

452
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,994
But Miss Hermione Granger...

453
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,915
...knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil...

454
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,669
...and market my own range of hair-care potions. Good girl.

455
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,007
Now, be warned.

456
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,301
It is my job to arm you...

457
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:58,806
...against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.

458
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:03,227
You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.

459
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,440
Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.

460
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,568
I must ask you not to scream.

461
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,279
It might provoke them.

462
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,284
Cornish pixies?

463
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,537
LOCKHART: Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

464
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,415
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

465
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,753
...but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.

466
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,839
Let's see what you make of them.

467
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,430
Come on now, round them up. They're only pixies.

468
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:59,325
PIXIE: You just stay there! NEVILLE: Please, get me down!

469
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,122
HERMIONE: Get off me! - Stop. Hold still!

470
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,960
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

471
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:33,234
I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.

472
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,155
What do we do now?

473
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,158
Immobulus!

474
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,878
Why is it always me?

475
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,970
I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.

476
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,807
We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer.

477
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,269
What-? I don't believe it.

478
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:13,774
- Where you think you're going, Flint? - Quidditch practice.

479
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,321
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today. - Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

480
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,949
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

481
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:26,078
"I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team...

482
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,749
...permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker. "

483
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,585
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

484
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,175
- Malfoy? - That's right.

485
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,136
And that's not all that's new this year.

486
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:46,432
Those are Nimbus 2001 s. How did you get those?

487
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,643
A gift from Draco's father.

488
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,605
You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.

489
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,775
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.

490
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,819
They got in on pure talent.

491
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,952
No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.

492
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,874
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!

493
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,300
You okay, Ron?

494
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,138
Say something.

495
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:36,857
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry? HARRY: No, Colin, get out of the way.

496
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,819
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

497
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,154
He'll know what to do.

498
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:54,375
HAGRID: This calls for a specialist's equipment.

499
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:01,716
Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid.

500
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,553
- Okay. - Better out than in.

501
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:11,517
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway? - Malfoy. He called Hermione...

502
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:16,105
Well, I don't know exactly what it means.

503
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,278
He called me a Mudblood.

504
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,114
- He did not. - What's a Mudblood?

505
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:30,036
It means "dirty blood. " Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

506
00:46:30,203 --> 00:46:34,457
Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me.

507
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:39,086
It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.

508
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:45,051
See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

509
00:46:45,218 --> 00:46:49,889
...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood.

510
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,724
That's horrible.

511
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,062
It's disgusting.

512
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:59,732
And it's codswallop to boot. Dirty blood.

513
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,235
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less.

514
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:07,948
More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

515
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,368
Come here.

516
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:17,917
Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute.

517
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,794
Aye?

518
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,761
LOCKHART: Harry, Harry, Harry.

519
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,138
Can you possibly imagine...

520
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,517
...a better way to serve detention...

521
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,853
...than by helping me to answer my fan mail?

522
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,438
Not really.

523
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:45,986
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does.

524
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,114
Remember that.

525
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,994
VOICE: Come.

526
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,288
Come...

527
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,459
...to me.

528
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,298
- What? - Sorry?

529
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,469
That voice.

530
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,179
Voice?

531
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,354
- Didn't you hear it? - What are you talking about, Harry?

532
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,567
I think you're getting a bit drowsy.

533
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,821
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours.

534
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,491
Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.

535
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,999
Spooky.

536
00:48:43,044 --> 00:48:45,171
VOICE: Blood.

537
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:48,883
I smell blood.

538
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,178
Let me rip you.

539
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:55,890
Let me kill you.

540
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,479
Kill!

541
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,064
- Kill! - Harry!

542
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,734
HARRY: Did you hear it? - Hear what?

543
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,362
- That voice. - Voice? What voice?

544
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,492
I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just-

545
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,869
It's time.

546
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,206
It's moving. I think it's going to kill.

547
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:25,127
RON: Kill? HERMIONE: Harry, wait! Not so fast!

548
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,780
Strange.

549
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:57,785
- I've never seen spiders act like that. - I don't like spiders.

550
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,958
What's that?

551
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,922
HERMIONE: "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened.

552
00:50:10,131 --> 00:50:11,966
Enemies of the Heir, beware. "

553
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:14,426
It's written in blood.

554
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,473
Oh, no.

555
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,480
It's Filch's cat.

556
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,275
It's Mrs. Norris.

557
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,085
"Enemies of the Heir, beware. "

558
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,964
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

559
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:57,303
What's going on here? Go on. Make way, make way.

560
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,556
Potter?

561
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,850
What are you...?

562
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:08,480
Mrs. Norris?

563
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:14,153
- You've murdered my cat. - No. No.

564
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,821
FILCH: I'll kill you.

565
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,993
- I'll kill you! DUMBLEDORE: Argus!

566
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,538
Argus, I...

567
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:31,170
Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.

568
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,881
Everyone except...

569
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,884
...you three.

570
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,764
BOY: Ravenclaws, follow me.

571
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:47,519
She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified.

572
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,522
Ah. Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there.

573
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,901
I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.

574
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:58,864
But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say.

575
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,867
Ask him. It's him that's done it.

576
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,703
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

577
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,958
It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.

578
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,587
- Rubbish. - If I might, headmaster?

579
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:18,884
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

580
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,261
However...

581
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,556
...the circumstances are suspicious.

582
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:29,395
I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.

583
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:31,772
LOCKHART: I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

584
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,401
You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.

585
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:38,821
HERMIONE: That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor.

586
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,740
We'd just found him when he said...

587
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,830
- Yes, Miss Granger? - When I said I wasn't hungry.

588
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:53,252
We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.

589
00:52:55,588 --> 00:53:01,093
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus. FILCH: My cat has been Petrified.

590
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:07,766
- I want to see some punishment! - We will be able to cure her, Argus.

591
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:13,480
As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

592
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:18,110
When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.

593
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,112
And in the meantime...

594
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,658
...I strongly recommend caution...

595
00:53:25,326 --> 00:53:27,327
...to all.

596
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:41,800
HERMIONE: It's a bit strange, isn't it? - Strange?

597
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,720
HERMIONE: You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear...

598
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:49,641
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.

599
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,020
Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

600
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,646
Are you mad?

601
00:53:54,814 --> 00:54:00,319
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.

602
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,823
MAN IN PICTURE: She's right, you know.

603
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,497
MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention, please?

604
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:17,503
Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals...

605
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,047
...into water goblets.

606
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,674
Like so.

607
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:27,721
One, two, three. Vera Verto.

608
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:35,187
Now it's your turn. Who would like to go first?

609
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:40,734
Mr. Weasley. "One, two, three. Vera Verto. "

610
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,406
Vera Verto!

611
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,207
MCGONAGALL: That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley.

612
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,710
- Yes, Miss Granger? - Professor...

613
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:03,090
...I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.

614
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,556
Very well.

615
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,059
You all know, of course...

616
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:18,063
...that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago...

617
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:22,651
...by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:

618
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,572
Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff...

619
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:32,411
...Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.

620
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:39,084
Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously.

621
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,254
- One did not. - Three guesses who.

622
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,424
Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective...

623
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,760
...about the students admitted to Hogwarts.

624
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:53,515
He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.

625
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,809
In other words, pure-bloods.

626
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:01,523
Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school.

627
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,610
Now, according to legend...

628
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:08,488
...Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle...

629
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:12,326
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

630
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:16,955
Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it...

631
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:21,210
...until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.

632
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,795
The Heir alone...

633
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,632
...would be able to open the Chamber...

634
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:31,511
...and unleash the horror within, and by so doing...

635
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,057
...purge the school of all those who...

636
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:40,229
...in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.

637
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,981
Muggle-borns.

638
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,653
Naturally, the school has been searched many times.

639
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,323
No such chamber has been found.

640
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:56,536
Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?

641
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,998
The Chamber is said to be home to something...

642
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,710
...that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.

643
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:08,006
It is said to be the home...

644
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,758
...of a monster.

645
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,184
Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

646
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:23,563
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.

647
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:27,567
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means-

648
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:31,697
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

649
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:36,243
Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

650
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,079
- If you're talking about Malfoy- - Of course. You heard him.

651
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,956
"You'll be next, Mudbloods. "

652
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,750
I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

653
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,087
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family.

654
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,048
The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.

655
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:53,635
Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.

656
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:58,265
Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way.

657
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,267
Mind you, it would be difficult.

658
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,478
Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...

659
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:08,108
...and it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.

660
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,409
HERMIONE: Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.

661
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,287
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker...

662
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,750
...to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another. "

663
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:28,670
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

664
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,257
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything. - Exactly.

665
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:36,261
But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.

666
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,556
HARRY: How long will it take to make? - A month.

667
00:58:39,932 --> 00:58:41,350
A month?

668
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:45,354
But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

669
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:48,774
...he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

670
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:50,817
I know.

671
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:53,820
But it's the only plan we've got.

672
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,206
Another goal for Slytherin!

673
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,919
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

674
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,715
Yeah!

675
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,284
All right there, Scarhead?

676
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,917
Watch yourself, Harry!

677
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,086
HARRY: Wood, look out!

678
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,080
Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.

679
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,041
That's been tampered with, that has.

680
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,084
I'll stop it.

681
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:17,881
No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

682
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,492
Training for the ballet, Potter?

683
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,733
You'll never catch me, Potter.

684
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:50,575
Let's go.

685
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:55,955
LEE: Harry Potter has caught the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!

686
01:04:02,254 --> 01:04:04,339
Finite Incantatem!

687
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,722
- Thank you. HERMIONE: Are you okay?

688
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,974
No. I think my arm is broken.

689
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,644
Not to worry. I will fix that arm of yours straightaway.

690
01:04:17,853 --> 01:04:22,065
- No. Not you. - Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

691
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,777
This won't hurt a bit.

692
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:34,911
Brackium Emendo!

693
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,005
Yes, well, that can sometimes happen...

694
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,425
...but the point is...

695
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:53,930
...you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken.

696
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,766
Broken? There's no bones left.

697
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,437
LOCKHART: Much more flexible, though.

698
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,818
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss. You can go. Out of my way.

699
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,945
Should have been brought straight to me.

700
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,656
I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back...

701
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,324
You will be able to, won't you?

702
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,619
I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful.

703
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:21,958
You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

704
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,839
What do you expect? Pumpkin juice?

705
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,222
VOICE: Kill.

706
01:05:37,057 --> 01:05:38,641
Kill.

707
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:47,192
Time to kill.

708
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,365
Hello.

709
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,202
Dobby?

710
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:59,704
Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.

711
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:03,875
Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.

712
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:08,671
It was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.

713
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,966
Indeed. Yes, sir.

714
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:18,014
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled. - At least you would be away from here.

715
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,850
Harry Potter must go home.

716
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,562
Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see-

717
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:28,107
Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?

718
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:31,861
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

719
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:35,698
Dobby had to iron his hands.

720
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:42,497
You better clear off before my bones come back, or I might strangle you.

721
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,085
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

722
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,296
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

723
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,258
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?

724
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:57,428
Not kill you, sir. Never kill you.

725
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:00,932
Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed...

726
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,227
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

727
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:08,106
We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir.

728
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:13,736
Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin.

729
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,665
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

730
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:30,962
This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement.

731
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:35,592
Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.

732
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,762
Listen.

733
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,472
Listen!

734
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,351
Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.

735
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,438
Harry Potter must not stay here...

736
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:53,151
...now that history is to repeat itself.

737
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,779
Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?

738
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,948
I shouldn't have said that.

739
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,830
- Bad Dobby! Bad! - Stop it!

740
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,665
Stop it, Dobby!

741
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:13,171
Tell me. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?

742
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:18,551
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

743
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,012
No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?

744
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,609
POMFREY: Put him here.

745
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,198
What happened?

746
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,158
DUMBLEDORE: There's been another attack.

747
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:48,039
I think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey.

748
01:08:48,832 --> 01:08:53,544
Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.

749
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,389
MCGONAGALL: What can this mean, Albus?

750
01:09:04,556 --> 01:09:06,516
It means...

751
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,686
...that our students are in great danger.

752
01:09:09,853 --> 01:09:13,231
- What should I tell the staff? DUMBLEDORE: The truth.

753
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:17,276
Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.

754
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,571
It is as we feared, Minerva.

755
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:25,368
The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.

756
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:32,375
HERMIONE: You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?

757
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,253
Of course. Don't you see?

758
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,423
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.

759
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,634
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it. - Maybe.

760
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,971
We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

761
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:49,100
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight...

762
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:53,229
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?

763
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,774
No. No one ever comes in here.

764
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:00,194
- Why? - Moaning Myrtle.

765
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,863
Who?

766
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,449
Moaning Myrtle.

767
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:08,077
- Who's Moaning Myrtle? - I'm Moaning Myrtle.

768
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,419
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

769
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,589
Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable...

770
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:23,134
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

771
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,477
She's a little sensitive.

772
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,941
LOCKHART: Gather round!

773
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:44,280
Gather round. Can everybody see me?

774
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,617
Can you all hear me?

775
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:49,619
Excellent.

776
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,790
In light of the dark events of recent weeks...

777
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:58,628
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club...

778
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:03,466
...to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves...

779
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,302
...as I myself have done on countless occasions.

780
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:10,139
For full details, see my published works.

781
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,481
That Lockhart's something, isn't he? Awfully brave chap.

782
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:19,941
Justin Finch-Fletchley.

783
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:21,859
- Hufflepuff. - Nice to meet you. I'm-

784
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,279
I know who you are. We all do, even us Muggle-borns.

785
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,574
Let me introduce my assistant...

786
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:31,410
...Professor Snape.

787
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:37,500
He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.

788
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,752
I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.

789
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,799
You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.

790
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,066
One.

791
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,276
Two.

792
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,113
- Three! - Expelliarmus!

793
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,374
- Do you think he's all right? - Who cares?

794
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,502
An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape...

795
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:26,215
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do.

796
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,635
If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.

797
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,306
Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students...

798
01:12:33,473 --> 01:12:37,977
...to block unfriendly spells, professor.

799
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,148
An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape.

800
01:12:43,358 --> 01:12:47,653
Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you?

801
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:51,324
SNAPE: Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.

802
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,411
We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

803
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:59,665
Might I suggest someone from my own house?

804
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:03,461
Malfoy, perhaps?

805
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:13,471
LOCKHART: Good luck, Potter. - Thank you, sir.

806
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,397
LOCKHART: Wands at the ready.

807
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,026
- Scared, Potter? - You wish.

808
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:39,121
LOCKHART: On the count of three...

809
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:43,626
...cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.

810
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:47,380
We don't want any accidents here. One.

811
01:13:49,132 --> 01:13:51,717
- Two. - Everte Statum!

812
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,564
Rictusempra!

813
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:18,327
I said disarm only.

814
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,538
Serpensortia!

815
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:31,966
Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.

816
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:37,596
Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte Ascendare!

817
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,808
Vipera Evanesca.

818
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,859
What are you playing at?

819
01:15:44,664 --> 01:15:47,333
You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?

820
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,752
- I'm a what? - You can talk to snakes.

821
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,257
I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

822
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:59,386
Once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.

823
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:03,349
No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry.

824
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,518
This is bad.

825
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:09,438
What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin-

826
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:13,067
- That's what you said to it. - You were there. You heard me.

827
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:17,113
I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.

828
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,199
I spoke a different language?

829
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,619
But I didn't realize-

830
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:26,580
How can I speak a language without knowing I can?

831
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:30,751
I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.

832
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,670
Harry, listen to me.

833
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:35,923
There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.

834
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:40,594
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.

835
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:41,887
Exactly.

836
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:45,432
Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.

837
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,601
But I'm not.

838
01:16:50,313 --> 01:16:52,273
I can't be.

839
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,442
HERMIONE: He lived a thousand years ago.

840
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,821
For all we know, you could be.

841
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,671
Who am I, Hedwig?

842
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,382
What am I?

843
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:56,503
I'll see you back in the common room.

844
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,355
So anyway, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory.

845
01:18:14,522 --> 01:18:18,901
I mean to say, if Potter has marked him down as his next victim...

846
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,654
...it's best he keeps a low profile for a while.

847
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:24,573
But why would he want to attack Justin?

848
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:29,495
Well, Justin let it slip to Potter that he was Muggle-born.

849
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:33,499
And you definitely think Potter is the Heir of Slytherin?

850
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:37,002
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.

851
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,880
Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard.

852
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:44,176
Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes?

853
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:47,513
They called Slytherin himself "Serpent-tongue. "

854
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,307
Harry always seemed so nice though.

855
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:54,979
And after all, he is the one who made You-Know-Who disappear.

856
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:59,441
That's probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place.

857
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,945
Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him.

858
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,670
Hello, Harry. You all right?

859
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,673
Hagrid. What are you doing here?

860
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,925
Second one killed this term.

861
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,470
Now, I reckon it's either a fox or a Blood-Sucking Bugbear.

862
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:31,098
I've been up at Dumbledore's getting permission...

863
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,892
...to put a little charm round the old hen coop.

864
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:39,231
You sure you're all right? You're awful hot and bothered.

865
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,025
It's nothing.

866
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:45,654
Look, I'd better get going. I've got a lot of studying to...

867
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,717
VOICE: I want blood.

868
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:14,600
They all must die.

869
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:23,025
Kill.

870
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,404
Time to kill.

871
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,565
Caught in the act.

872
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:05,651
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

873
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:08,654
Mark my words.

874
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:13,075
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand-

875
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,770
Professor...

876
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:43,313
...I swear I didn't.

877
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,775
This is out of my hands, Potter.

878
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:59,079
Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.

879
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:10,591
Sherbet Lemon.

880
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,668
Professor Dumbledore?

881
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,854
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

882
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:13,237
I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.

883
01:23:13,404 --> 01:23:18,867
Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.

884
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:22,579
But I stand by what I said last year.

885
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:26,124
You would have done well in Slytherin.

886
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:27,668
You're wrong.

887
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:58,323
DUMBLEDORE: Harry?

888
01:23:58,741 --> 01:24:00,951
Professor.

889
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:04,913
Your bird... There was nothing I could do.

890
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:08,834
- He just caught fire. - And about time too.

891
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,004
He's been looking dreadful for days.

892
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,214
Pity you had to see him on a burning day.

893
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:19,344
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

894
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:22,848
They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...

895
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,142
...and then they are...

896
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,353
...reborn from the ashes.

897
01:24:36,779 --> 01:24:39,364
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

898
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:43,702
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

899
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,747
Their tears have healing powers.

900
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:52,377
Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen!

901
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:55,505
Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry.

902
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,634
- Hagrid- - I'd swear it in front of the Ministry.

903
01:24:58,801 --> 01:25:00,636
Hagrid.

904
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,888
Relax.

905
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,641
I do not believe...

906
01:25:05,808 --> 01:25:10,270
- ... that Harry attacked anyone. - Of course you don't.

907
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,856
Oh.

908
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:15,651
Right. Well, I'll...

909
01:25:15,818 --> 01:25:18,904
- I'll just wait outside, then. - Yes.

910
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:26,244
- You don't think it was me, professor? - No, Harry.

911
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:28,914
I do not think it was you.

912
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,792
But I must ask you...

913
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:36,421
...is there something you wish to tell me?

914
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,930
No, sir.

915
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:46,598
Nothing.

916
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:51,770
Very well, then.

917
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:53,688
Off you go.

918
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,502
Hey, look, everyone. It's the Heir of Slytherin.

919
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:19,923
Be careful. He's a seriously evil wizard.

920
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:23,885
Oh, come on, Harry. Fred and George were just having a laugh.

921
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:26,263
They're the only ones.

922
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,517
Half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night.

923
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,768
Who cares?

924
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:33,854
Maybe they're right.

925
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:39,192
HERMIONE: Harry. Harry!

926
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:41,820
Oh, come on.

927
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,781
Look, I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue.

928
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:48,160
What else don't I know about myself?

929
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:51,079
Look...

930
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,459
...maybe you can do something...

931
01:26:55,626 --> 01:26:58,128
...even something horrible...

932
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,172
...and not know you did it.

933
01:27:00,339 --> 01:27:03,717
You don't believe that, Harry. I know you don't.

934
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:08,305
And if it makes you feel any better, Malfoy's staying for the holidays too.

935
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,266
Why would that make anyone feel any better?

936
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:15,645
Because in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion will be ready.

937
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:18,023
In a few days...

938
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:21,359
...we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin.

939
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:50,680
Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.

940
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:52,557
Crabbe and Goyle.

941
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:55,519
We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

942
01:27:55,686 --> 01:27:58,939
...can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.

943
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,983
- How? - I've got it all worked out.

944
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:04,694
I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.

945
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:07,656
Simple, but powerful.

946
01:28:07,823 --> 01:28:09,991
Now, once they're asleep...

947
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,370
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs...

948
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,413
...and put on their uniforms.

949
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:18,875
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then? - I've already got mine.

950
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:22,212
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

951
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,548
I got this off her robes.

952
01:28:24,715 --> 01:28:27,342
I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.

953
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,220
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.

954
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,734
Ron, maybe I should do it.

955
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:46,987
Yeah. Right.

956
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:51,032
Wingardium Leviosa.

957
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,752
Cool.

958
01:29:25,901 --> 01:29:27,736
How thick could you get?

959
01:29:27,903 --> 01:29:29,904
Come on, let's get them.

960
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:47,213
Well, did you get the hairs?

961
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:49,799
What are those?

962
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:53,178
Slytherin robes. I had to sneak them from the laundry.

963
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,973
Are we going to drink that?

964
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:58,224
Mm.

965
01:30:03,105 --> 01:30:07,108
HERMIONE: We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.

966
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:17,202
Add the hairs.

967
01:30:20,664 --> 01:30:23,500
Ugh. Essence of Crabbe.

968
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,585
HERMIONE: Cheers.

969
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:36,679
I think I'm gonna be sick.

970
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:41,476
Me too.

971
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:28,064
Harry?

972
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:30,066
Ron.

973
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,027
Bloody hell!

974
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:36,072
We still sound like ourselves.

975
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,032
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

976
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:41,453
- Bloody hell. - Excellent.

977
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:44,289
- But where's Hermione? HERMIONE: I...

978
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,459
I don't think I'm going. You go on without me.

979
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,377
Hermione, are you okay?

980
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:52,380
HERMIONE: Just go. You're wasting time.

981
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,092
Come on.

982
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:03,475
- The Slytherin common room's this way. - Okay.

983
01:32:05,936 --> 01:32:08,396
PERCY: Excuse me.

984
01:32:10,232 --> 01:32:12,108
What are you doing d-?

985
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:14,402
I mean, what are you doing down here?

986
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,990
I happen to be a school prefect.

987
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,620
You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night.

988
01:32:24,246 --> 01:32:26,080
What are your names again?

989
01:32:26,248 --> 01:32:30,251
- I'm... - Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

990
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:33,421
Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?

991
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:37,258
Why are you wearing glasses?

992
01:32:38,093 --> 01:32:40,929
- Reading. - Reading?

993
01:32:42,097 --> 01:32:44,349
I didn't know you could read.

994
01:32:47,269 --> 01:32:49,312
And what are you doing down here, Weasley?

995
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,523
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

996
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:02,325
Well, sit down.

997
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,957
You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

998
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:13,002
They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.

999
01:33:13,837 --> 01:33:16,130
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

1000
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:20,134
Stomachache.

1001
01:33:22,137 --> 01:33:26,975
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

1002
01:33:27,142 --> 01:33:29,561
I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.

1003
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:32,230
Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing...

1004
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:36,192
- ... that ever happened to this place. - You're wrong!

1005
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,867
What?

1006
01:33:45,035 --> 01:33:48,705
You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?

1007
01:33:48,872 --> 01:33:51,332
Well? Do you?

1008
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,710
Harry Potter?

1009
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,676
Good one, Goyle.

1010
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:03,386
You're absolutely right.

1011
01:34:04,054 --> 01:34:05,888
Saint Potter.

1012
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:09,684
And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

1013
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,065
But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.

1014
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:19,902
You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday.

1015
01:34:20,904 --> 01:34:23,406
How many times do I have to tell you?

1016
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:26,242
Is this yours?

1017
01:34:30,706 --> 01:34:33,082
But my father did say this:

1018
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:36,377
It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.

1019
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:40,923
He wouldn't tell me who opened it. Only that they were expelled.

1020
01:34:41,216 --> 01:34:45,887
The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.

1021
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:50,391
So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.

1022
01:34:50,934 --> 01:34:52,769
As for me...

1023
01:34:52,936 --> 01:34:55,104
...I hope it's Granger.

1024
01:34:55,272 --> 01:34:57,482
What's the matter with you two?

1025
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,151
You're acting very odd.

1026
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,570
It's his stomachache.

1027
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,781
Calm down.

1028
01:35:08,952 --> 01:35:10,953
Scar.

1029
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:15,958
Hair.

1030
01:35:22,132 --> 01:35:24,509
Hey! Where are you going?

1031
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,366
That was close.

1032
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,993
Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you.

1033
01:35:51,161 --> 01:35:52,995
HERMIONE: Go away.

1034
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:57,375
Wait till you see. It's awful.

1035
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:01,087
Hermione?

1036
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,880
Are you okay?

1037
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,718
HERMIONE: Do you remember me telling you...

1038
01:36:06,885 --> 01:36:10,054
...that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?

1039
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:14,350
It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

1040
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,271
Look at my face.

1041
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:21,858
Look at your tail.

1042
01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:29,866
RON: Have you spoken to Hermione?

1043
01:36:30,033 --> 01:36:32,577
She should be out of hospital in a few days...

1044
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,580
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

1045
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:42,086
What's this?

1046
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:47,759
RON: Yuck!

1047
01:36:47,926 --> 01:36:50,720
HARRY: Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.

1048
01:37:06,945 --> 01:37:11,073
- Come to throw something else at me? - Why would I throw something at you?

1049
01:37:11,533 --> 01:37:15,578
Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business...

1050
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:19,415
...and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.

1051
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:22,460
But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.

1052
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:25,087
I mean, it'll just go right through you.

1053
01:37:26,089 --> 01:37:30,468
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.

1054
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:33,262
Ten points if you get it through her stomach!

1055
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:36,933
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

1056
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:41,854
- But who threw it at you, anyway? - I don't know. I didn't see them.

1057
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:46,442
I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death...

1058
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:50,321
...and it fell through the top of my head. Uh-huh.

1059
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:11,342
HERMIONE: There's a name in this diary.

1060
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:15,972
"Tom Marvolo Riddle. "

1061
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:18,015
RON: Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1062
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:22,645
Hang on. I know that name.

1063
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:25,314
Why do I know that name?

1064
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:28,609
Of course. That night I had detention.

1065
01:38:28,777 --> 01:38:31,946
My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room.

1066
01:38:32,114 --> 01:38:33,739
I remember...

1067
01:38:33,907 --> 01:38:36,993
...because I kept burping up slugs over Tom Riddle's trophy.

1068
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:41,581
- What was the trophy for? - He won an award 50 years ago.

1069
01:38:41,748 --> 01:38:44,250
Special services to the school or something.

1070
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,043
HERMIONE: Fifty years ago? Are you sure?

1071
01:38:46,211 --> 01:38:47,628
RON: Yeah. Why?

1072
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:50,214
Don't you remember what Malfoy told you?

1073
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:53,092
- Last time the Chamber was opened- - Fifty years ago.

1074
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:55,511
- That means- HERMIONE: Tom Riddle was here...

1075
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,722
...at Hogwarts when it happened.

1076
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:00,558
What if he wrote about what he saw?

1077
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:04,353
It's possible he knew where the Chamber was. How to open it.

1078
01:39:04,521 --> 01:39:07,398
Even what sort of creature lives in it.

1079
01:39:07,941 --> 01:39:10,276
If so, whoever's behind these attacks...

1080
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:13,988
...wouldn't want this diary lying around, would they?

1081
01:39:14,364 --> 01:39:18,367
It's a brilliant theory, Hermione, but there's just one flaw.

1082
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,829
There's nothing written in this diary.

1083
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,017
Do you mind?

1084
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:53,110
HARRY: "Tom Marvolo Riddle. "

1085
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:25,309
My name...

1086
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:28,396
...is Harry...

1087
01:40:30,023 --> 01:40:32,149
...Potter.

1088
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:50,543
Do you know anything...

1089
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:57,466
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

1090
01:41:08,186 --> 01:41:10,104
Can you...

1091
01:41:11,356 --> 01:41:13,691
...tell me?

1092
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:19,381
Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here?

1093
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,137
Are you Tom Riddle?

1094
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:27,098
Hello, can you hear me?

1095
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:49,453
DUMBLEDORE: Riddle!

1096
01:42:49,996 --> 01:42:51,539
Come.

1097
01:42:51,706 --> 01:42:53,707
Professor Dumbledore.

1098
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:58,045
Dumbledore?

1099
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:02,842
It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.

1100
01:43:03,009 --> 01:43:06,345
RIDDLE: Yes, professor. I suppose I...

1101
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,681
I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.

1102
01:43:09,307 --> 01:43:12,184
I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true.

1103
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:15,187
About the school as well? I don't have a home to go to.

1104
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:18,190
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor?

1105
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:20,943
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

1106
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,655
...Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.

1107
01:43:24,823 --> 01:43:29,326
Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught...

1108
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:33,664
Is there something...

1109
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:36,584
...you wish to tell me?

1110
01:43:37,836 --> 01:43:40,337
No, sir. Nothing.

1111
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:50,181
Very well, then. Off you go.

1112
01:43:50,348 --> 01:43:52,183
Good night, sir.

1113
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:31,222
HAGRID: Let's get you out of there. RIDDLE: Evening, Hagrid.

1114
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:35,893
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone...

1115
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,395
You can't. You don't understand.

1116
01:44:38,563 --> 01:44:41,732
The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

1117
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,777
...is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.

1118
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:48,155
It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one. Never.

1119
01:44:48,531 --> 01:44:50,658
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1120
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:52,451
- Now, stand aside. - No!

1121
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:54,578
- Stand aside, Hagrid. - No!

1122
01:44:54,746 --> 01:44:56,413
Cistem Aperio!

1123
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:05,673
Arania Exumai!

1124
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:08,008
HAGRID: Aragog!

1125
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:09,426
Aragog!

1126
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,345
RIDDLE: I can't let you go.

1127
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:15,182
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled.

1128
01:45:17,769 --> 01:45:29,196
Hagrid!

1129
01:45:41,126 --> 01:45:42,960
Whoa.

1130
01:45:48,049 --> 01:45:51,176
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1131
01:45:52,178 --> 01:45:54,388
What? What happened?

1132
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:58,726
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1133
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,741
HARRY: It was Hagrid.

1134
01:46:13,908 --> 01:46:16,618
HERMIONE: It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.

1135
01:46:16,828 --> 01:46:20,873
We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

1136
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,543
The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?

1137
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:28,839
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?

1138
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,717
That would be a cheerful visit. "Hello, Hagrid.

1139
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:35,721
Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

1140
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:39,058
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you?

1141
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:40,392
No.

1142
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:46,565
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

1143
01:46:46,983 --> 01:46:51,570
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know.

1144
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:55,407
Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do.

1145
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:59,078
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them...

1146
01:46:59,245 --> 01:47:02,498
...and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified.

1147
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:06,835
In the meantime, though, you three...

1148
01:47:07,003 --> 01:47:10,172
...had best be looking after yourselves. All right?

1149
01:47:11,883 --> 01:47:13,801
Hm.

1150
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:19,973
Hello, Neville.

1151
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:23,602
Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come.

1152
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:25,646
Come on!

1153
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:52,214
HERMIONE: It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password.

1154
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:54,633
Unless it wasn't a student.

1155
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:58,220
Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.

1156
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:59,805
HARRY: And they found it.

1157
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:03,058
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

1158
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:05,978
WOOD: All right, listen up.

1159
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:09,022
We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

1160
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:11,066
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

1161
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:14,236
Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them...

1162
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:17,948
- ... if they fly anywhere near him. - Well, that too.

1163
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:20,659
Professor McGonagall.

1164
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:23,871
- This match has been canceled. - We can't cancel Quidditch.

1165
01:48:24,038 --> 01:48:29,001
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1166
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:31,837
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1167
01:48:32,213 --> 01:48:34,756
There's something the both of you have to see.

1168
01:48:36,843 --> 01:48:40,471
I warn you. This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1169
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:50,022
Hermione!

1170
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:53,066
MCGONAGALL: She was found near the library...

1171
01:48:53,234 --> 01:48:55,277
...along with this.

1172
01:48:56,738 --> 01:48:59,573
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1173
01:48:59,741 --> 01:49:01,200
No.

1174
01:49:15,423 --> 01:49:17,758
MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention, please?

1175
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:23,555
Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately:

1176
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:29,061
"All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1177
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:33,273
All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.

1178
01:49:33,441 --> 01:49:36,443
No exceptions. "

1179
01:49:37,111 --> 01:49:39,154
I should tell you this:

1180
01:49:39,322 --> 01:49:43,450
Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught...

1181
01:49:44,035 --> 01:49:47,162
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1182
01:49:58,675 --> 01:50:01,635
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him...

1183
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:04,096
...but if he did set the monster loose last time...

1184
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:07,432
...he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1185
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,850
But you heard McGonagall.

1186
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:12,312
We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.

1187
01:50:12,772 --> 01:50:15,274
I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.

1188
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:27,244
- Ready? - Yeah.

1189
01:50:46,889 --> 01:50:48,640
Who's there?

1190
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:56,148
Hello?

1191
01:50:57,317 --> 01:51:01,653
- What's that for? - Nothing. I was expecting, uh...

1192
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:05,657
It doesn't matter. Come on in. I just made a pot of tea.

1193
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:10,704
Hagrid, are you okay?

1194
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:13,749
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1195
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:16,418
Did you hear about Hermione?

1196
01:51:16,919 --> 01:51:20,630
Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1197
01:51:20,923 --> 01:51:24,634
Look, we have to ask you something.

1198
01:51:26,262 --> 01:51:29,765
Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?

1199
01:51:32,143 --> 01:51:34,019
What you had to understand about that is-

1200
01:51:36,064 --> 01:51:37,689
Quick, under the cloak.

1201
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:41,401
Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you.

1202
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:50,911
- Professor Dumbledore, sir. - Good evening, Hagrid.

1203
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:53,538
I wonder, could we...?

1204
01:51:53,706 --> 01:51:56,208
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1205
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:57,709
That's Dad's boss.

1206
01:51:57,877 --> 01:52:01,463
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1207
01:52:01,672 --> 01:52:06,051
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business. Had to come.

1208
01:52:06,219 --> 01:52:09,429
Three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough.

1209
01:52:09,597 --> 01:52:12,808
- The Ministry's got to act. - But I never-

1210
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:14,810
You know I never, professor.

1211
01:52:14,977 --> 01:52:18,063
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1212
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:20,065
...that Hagrid...

1213
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:22,567
...has my full confidence.

1214
01:52:22,735 --> 01:52:26,488
Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him.

1215
01:52:26,697 --> 01:52:29,241
- I've got to take him. HAGRID: Take me?

1216
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:31,701
Take me where? Not Azkaban prison.

1217
01:52:31,953 --> 01:52:35,747
FUDGE: I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1218
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:38,250
Already here, Fudge?

1219
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:39,751
Good.

1220
01:52:40,711 --> 01:52:43,422
What are you doing here? Get out of my house!

1221
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:45,632
LUCIUS: Believe me...

1222
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:50,137
...I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your...

1223
01:52:52,014 --> 01:52:54,266
You call this a house?

1224
01:52:55,309 --> 01:52:56,351
No.

1225
01:52:56,519 --> 01:53:00,439
I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.

1226
01:53:00,606 --> 01:53:04,651
Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?

1227
01:53:05,236 --> 01:53:09,948
The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.

1228
01:53:11,617 --> 01:53:14,494
This is an order of suspension.

1229
01:53:20,042 --> 01:53:23,462
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1230
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:31,511
I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.

1231
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:34,556
Well, what with all these attacks...

1232
01:53:34,765 --> 01:53:37,517
...there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1233
01:53:37,685 --> 01:53:42,230
I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.

1234
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:44,649
HAGRID: You can't take Professor Dumbledore away.

1235
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:47,486
Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.

1236
01:53:47,653 --> 01:53:50,071
You mark my words, there'll be killings next!

1237
01:53:50,281 --> 01:53:51,907
You think so?

1238
01:53:52,074 --> 01:53:54,576
DUMBLEDORE: Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1239
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:58,663
If the governors desire my removal...

1240
01:53:58,831 --> 01:54:02,542
...I will, of course, step aside.

1241
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:06,379
However...

1242
01:54:07,048 --> 01:54:11,593
...you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts...

1243
01:54:11,802 --> 01:54:13,678
...to those who...

1244
01:54:13,846 --> 01:54:16,181
...ask for it.

1245
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,273
Admirable sentiments.

1246
01:54:25,441 --> 01:54:27,317
Shall we?

1247
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:40,914
Fudge.

1248
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:44,459
Come, Hagrid.

1249
01:54:45,586 --> 01:54:47,128
Well?

1250
01:54:47,838 --> 01:54:48,880
HAGRID: If...

1251
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:51,883
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1252
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:56,888
...then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.

1253
01:54:57,056 --> 01:54:59,641
Yep. That would lead them right.

1254
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:01,768
That's all I have to say.

1255
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:07,232
Oh, and someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.

1256
01:55:10,611 --> 01:55:12,612
FUDGE: Good boy.

1257
01:55:18,744 --> 01:55:20,912
Hagrid's right.

1258
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,999
With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.

1259
01:55:24,166 --> 01:55:25,875
Look.

1260
01:55:31,924 --> 01:55:33,675
Come on.

1261
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:39,431
Come on, Fang.

1262
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:59,117
Come on.

1263
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:00,535
RON: What?

1264
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:03,955
HARRY: You heard what Hagrid said. "Follow the spiders. "

1265
01:56:04,165 --> 01:56:06,791
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1266
01:56:08,836 --> 01:56:13,298
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be "follow the butterflies"?

1267
01:56:46,957 --> 01:56:50,752
HARRY: There's something moving over there. Listen.

1268
01:56:51,837 --> 01:56:53,963
- It sounds like something big. - Big?

1269
01:56:59,303 --> 01:57:02,597
Harry! Harry, it's our car!

1270
01:57:03,641 --> 01:57:07,852
It must've been here all the time. And, look, the forest has turned it wild.

1271
01:57:10,648 --> 01:57:13,858
HARRY: Come on. We don't want to lose the trail.

1272
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:30,208
RON: Harry, I don't like this.

1273
01:57:35,339 --> 01:57:38,550
- Harry, I don't like this at all. - Shush!

1274
01:57:50,062 --> 01:57:52,564
Can we go back now?

1275
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,482
Come on.

1276
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,951
ARAGOG: Who is it?

1277
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,787
Don't panic.

1278
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:50,622
ARAGOG: Hagrid?

1279
01:58:50,998 --> 01:58:52,624
Is that you?

1280
01:58:53,167 --> 01:58:55,126
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1281
01:59:13,187 --> 01:59:16,439
And you? You're Aragog, aren't you?

1282
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:18,316
ARAGOG: Yes.

1283
01:59:18,484 --> 01:59:22,320
Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.

1284
01:59:22,488 --> 01:59:25,573
He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks.

1285
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,034
They think it's Hagrid.

1286
01:59:28,202 --> 01:59:31,830
They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1287
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:34,374
ARAGOG: That's a lie.

1288
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:37,752
Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1289
01:59:38,379 --> 01:59:41,256
- Then you're not the monster? ARAGOG: No.

1290
01:59:41,465 --> 01:59:44,509
The monster was born in the castle.

1291
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:50,014
I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.

1292
01:59:50,599 --> 01:59:53,476
- Harry. - Shush.

1293
01:59:54,186 --> 01:59:58,731
But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1294
01:59:58,899 --> 02:00:01,901
ARAGOG: We do not speak of it.

1295
02:00:02,236 --> 02:00:07,782
It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.

1296
02:00:07,992 --> 02:00:09,742
But have you seen it?

1297
02:00:10,411 --> 02:00:16,249
ARAGOG: I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which I was kept.

1298
02:00:16,417 --> 02:00:19,586
The girl was discovered in a bathroom.

1299
02:00:19,753 --> 02:00:24,257
When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.

1300
02:00:24,425 --> 02:00:26,426
- Harry! - What?

1301
02:00:39,273 --> 02:00:42,275
Well, thank you.

1302
02:00:43,235 --> 02:00:45,403
We'll just go.

1303
02:00:45,905 --> 02:00:47,614
ARAGOG: Go?

1304
02:00:47,823 --> 02:00:49,616
I think not.

1305
02:00:49,783 --> 02:00:55,246
My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1306
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:57,832
But I cannot deny them fresh meat...

1307
02:00:58,042 --> 02:01:02,337
...when it wanders so willingly into our midst.

1308
02:01:02,546 --> 02:01:06,299
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1309
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:08,301
Can we panic now?

1310
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:20,939
Know any spells?

1311
02:01:21,106 --> 02:01:24,275
One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.

1312
02:01:24,443 --> 02:01:27,195
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1313
02:01:40,709 --> 02:01:42,001
Let's go!

1314
02:01:47,132 --> 02:01:49,217
HARRY: Arania Exumai!

1315
02:01:54,515 --> 02:01:55,848
Go!

1316
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:08,152
Whoa!

1317
02:02:13,826 --> 02:02:15,910
Glad we're out of there.

1318
02:02:22,876 --> 02:02:25,211
Arania Exumai!

1319
02:02:30,926 --> 02:02:34,679
- Thanks for that. - Don't mention it.

1320
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:47,775
HARRY: Get us out of here.

1321
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:49,944
Now!

1322
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:56,284
Come on! Come on, move faster!

1323
02:02:58,954 --> 02:03:00,288
Come on! Go!

1324
02:03:17,806 --> 02:03:19,891
Get us in the air.

1325
02:03:20,934 --> 02:03:22,393
The flying gear's jammed!

1326
02:03:26,482 --> 02:03:30,276
HARRY: Come on! Pull! - I'm trying!

1327
02:03:59,598 --> 02:04:02,517
Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders.

1328
02:04:02,726 --> 02:04:07,021
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him.

1329
02:04:21,036 --> 02:04:24,288
I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?

1330
02:04:24,456 --> 02:04:29,043
- What have we found out? - We know one thing.

1331
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:32,630
Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1332
02:04:32,798 --> 02:04:34,799
He was innocent.

1333
02:04:50,315 --> 02:04:52,775
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1334
02:04:53,318 --> 02:04:55,570
We need you.

1335
02:04:56,488 --> 02:04:58,573
Now more than ever.

1336
02:05:15,507 --> 02:05:18,926
- What's that? - Ron...

1337
02:05:19,803 --> 02:05:24,223
This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.

1338
02:05:24,808 --> 02:05:26,017
Come on.

1339
02:05:26,685 --> 02:05:29,687
"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land...

1340
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:34,442
...none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1341
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:38,404
...instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.

1342
02:05:38,572 --> 02:05:41,574
Spiders flee before it. " Ron, this is it.

1343
02:05:41,742 --> 02:05:44,535
The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.

1344
02:05:44,703 --> 02:05:48,623
That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.

1345
02:05:48,957 --> 02:05:54,253
But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1346
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,850
Because no one did look it in the eye.

1347
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:12,396
Not directly, at least.

1348
02:06:13,607 --> 02:06:15,816
Colin saw it through his camera.

1349
02:06:15,984 --> 02:06:20,071
Justin- Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1350
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:24,242
Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1351
02:06:24,409 --> 02:06:27,495
And Hermione had the mirror.

1352
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:31,082
I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.

1353
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,500
And Mrs. Norris?

1354
02:06:32,668 --> 02:06:36,170
I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1355
02:06:37,756 --> 02:06:39,590
The water.

1356
02:06:40,092 --> 02:06:45,638
There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1357
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:53,688
"Spiders flee before it. "

1358
02:06:53,897 --> 02:06:57,608
- It all fits. - How's the basilisk been getting around?

1359
02:06:57,776 --> 02:07:00,611
A dirty, great snake. Someone would have seen it.

1360
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:06,450
HARRY: Hermione's answered that too. - Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1361
02:07:06,618 --> 02:07:10,871
Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?

1362
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:15,293
She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?

1363
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:17,295
Moaning Myrtle.

1364
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:22,300
MCGONAGALL: All students are to return to their dormitories at once.

1365
02:07:22,467 --> 02:07:25,928
All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.

1366
02:07:30,934 --> 02:07:36,731
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.

1367
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:39,150
Our worst fear has been realized.

1368
02:07:39,318 --> 02:07:43,863
A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.

1369
02:07:44,948 --> 02:07:50,578
The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1370
02:07:52,998 --> 02:07:55,416
So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?

1371
02:07:55,584 --> 02:07:59,920
A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1372
02:08:00,088 --> 02:08:03,049
- My moment? - Weren't you saying just last night...

1373
02:08:03,216 --> 02:08:07,762
...that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1374
02:08:09,097 --> 02:08:14,602
That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1375
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:19,940
- Your skills, after all, are legend. - Very well.

1376
02:08:20,108 --> 02:08:23,361
I'll just be in my office getting...

1377
02:08:24,196 --> 02:08:26,113
Getting ready.

1378
02:08:29,034 --> 02:08:32,244
Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?

1379
02:08:32,412 --> 02:08:34,246
Ginny Weasley.

1380
02:08:45,634 --> 02:08:48,719
RON: "Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. "

1381
02:08:52,766 --> 02:08:54,558
Ginny.

1382
02:08:56,645 --> 02:09:00,147
HARRY: Lockhart's useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.

1383
02:09:00,315 --> 02:09:03,067
At least we can tell him what we know.

1384
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:06,946
Professor, we have some information for you.

1385
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:10,658
Are you going somewhere?

1386
02:09:10,826 --> 02:09:13,953
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go.

1387
02:09:14,121 --> 02:09:17,331
- What about my sister? - Well...

1388
02:09:17,666 --> 02:09:21,168
As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.

1389
02:09:21,336 --> 02:09:25,339
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1390
02:09:25,549 --> 02:09:28,509
I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description-

1391
02:09:28,677 --> 02:09:29,844
You're running away?

1392
02:09:30,053 --> 02:09:32,805
- After all you did in your books? - Books can be misleading.

1393
02:09:32,973 --> 02:09:35,516
- You wrote them. - My dear boy, use your common sense.

1394
02:09:35,684 --> 02:09:40,104
My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things.

1395
02:09:40,689 --> 02:09:42,273
You're a fraud.

1396
02:09:42,441 --> 02:09:45,276
You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.

1397
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:47,361
Is there anything you can do?

1398
02:09:47,571 --> 02:09:52,283
Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1399
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:54,952
Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing.

1400
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:58,205
I'd never have sold another book.

1401
02:09:58,373 --> 02:10:04,128
In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you.

1402
02:10:04,629 --> 02:10:07,381
Don't even think about it.

1403
02:10:18,226 --> 02:10:19,685
MYRTLE: Who's there?

1404
02:10:22,147 --> 02:10:24,148
Hello, Harry.

1405
02:10:25,108 --> 02:10:30,237
- What do you want? - To ask you how you died.

1406
02:10:32,657 --> 02:10:35,075
It was dreadful.

1407
02:10:35,243 --> 02:10:38,913
It happened right here in this very cubicle.

1408
02:10:39,122 --> 02:10:43,167
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.

1409
02:10:43,335 --> 02:10:48,214
I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.

1410
02:10:48,381 --> 02:10:54,720
- Who was it, Myrtle? - I don't know. I was distraught!

1411
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:59,433
But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language.

1412
02:10:59,643 --> 02:11:05,940
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and...

1413
02:11:07,150 --> 02:11:11,946
- ... I died. - Just like that? How?

1414
02:11:12,155 --> 02:11:16,617
I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes...

1415
02:11:16,785 --> 02:11:20,663
...over there by that sink.

1416
02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:47,773
This is it.

1417
02:11:48,692 --> 02:11:53,487
This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1418
02:11:55,490 --> 02:12:00,327
Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue.

1419
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:55,966
Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well, then, I'll just be...

1420
02:12:56,134 --> 02:12:58,385
There's no need for me to stay.

1421
02:12:59,012 --> 02:13:00,888
HARRY: Yes, there is.

1422
02:13:02,766 --> 02:13:05,809
- You first. - Now, boys, what good will it do?

1423
02:13:05,977 --> 02:13:07,311
Better you than us.

1424
02:13:08,521 --> 02:13:11,482
But- Obviously, yes.

1425
02:13:15,779 --> 02:13:18,489
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1426
02:13:25,288 --> 02:13:28,499
LOCKHART: It's really quite filthy down here.

1427
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,504
- All right. Let's go. MYRTLE: Oh, Harry?

1428
02:13:33,922 --> 02:13:38,842
If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.

1429
02:13:41,388 --> 02:13:43,347
Thanks, Myrtle.

1430
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:10,374
RON: Ugh.

1431
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:17,631
Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.

1432
02:14:18,591 --> 02:14:20,259
RON: Go on.

1433
02:14:23,972 --> 02:14:25,347
HARRY: This way.

1434
02:14:32,355 --> 02:14:37,568
RON: What's this? - It looks like a snake.

1435
02:14:37,736 --> 02:14:41,405
HARRY: It's a snakeskin. RON: Bloody hell.

1436
02:14:41,573 --> 02:14:47,411
Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more.

1437
02:14:49,289 --> 02:14:52,249
Heart of a lion, this one.

1438
02:14:55,962 --> 02:15:00,632
The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret.

1439
02:15:02,594 --> 02:15:08,015
The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl.

1440
02:15:08,391 --> 02:15:11,852
How you two tragically lost your minds...

1441
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:15,022
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1442
02:15:15,899 --> 02:15:17,316
So...

1443
02:15:18,443 --> 02:15:20,778
You first, Mr. Potter.

1444
02:15:21,029 --> 02:15:24,198
Say goodbye to your memories.

1445
02:15:26,284 --> 02:15:28,202
Obliviate!

1446
02:15:54,938 --> 02:15:59,942
Harry.

1447
02:16:02,153 --> 02:16:05,239
- Ron! Ron, are you okay? - I'm fine.

1448
02:16:08,993 --> 02:16:10,744
Hello.

1449
02:16:11,454 --> 02:16:13,247
Who are you?

1450
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:17,334
- Ron Weasley. - Really?

1451
02:16:17,502 --> 02:16:20,337
And who am I?

1452
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:26,468
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1453
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:31,265
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1454
02:16:31,474 --> 02:16:33,559
Do you live here?

1455
02:16:34,269 --> 02:16:36,770
- No. - Really?

1456
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:43,193
- What do I do now? - You wait here...

1457
02:16:43,361 --> 02:16:46,280
...and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.

1458
02:16:46,489 --> 02:16:50,117
- I'll go on and find Ginny. RON: Okay.

1459
02:18:13,952 --> 02:18:15,786
Ginny.

1460
02:18:23,336 --> 02:18:27,214
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up, wake up.

1461
02:18:27,715 --> 02:18:29,800
Please wake up.

1462
02:18:30,093 --> 02:18:32,219
She won't wake.

1463
02:18:37,684 --> 02:18:42,020
Tom. Tom Riddle. What do you mean, she won't wake?

1464
02:18:42,188 --> 02:18:45,607
- She's not...? - She's still alive, but only just.

1465
02:18:46,609 --> 02:18:48,860
- Are you a ghost? - A memory...

1466
02:18:49,028 --> 02:18:51,405
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1467
02:18:54,117 --> 02:18:59,329
HARRY: She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1468
02:18:59,497 --> 02:19:01,873
You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk.

1469
02:19:02,041 --> 02:19:04,668
It won't come until it's called.

1470
02:19:07,422 --> 02:19:10,257
- Give me my wand, Tom. - You won't be needing it.

1471
02:19:11,342 --> 02:19:14,720
- We've got to go. We've got to save her. - I'm afraid I can't do that.

1472
02:19:14,887 --> 02:19:18,932
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.

1473
02:19:20,268 --> 02:19:24,771
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1474
02:19:24,939 --> 02:19:27,274
HARRY: No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1475
02:19:27,442 --> 02:19:30,694
RIDDLE: Ginny set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1476
02:19:30,862 --> 02:19:33,280
...Ginny wrote the threatening messages on the walls.

1477
02:19:33,448 --> 02:19:36,742
HARRY: But why? RIDDLE: Because I told her to.

1478
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:41,872
You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing.

1479
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:45,375
She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance.

1480
02:19:45,918 --> 02:19:48,420
Still, the power of the diary began to scare her.

1481
02:19:48,588 --> 02:19:50,964
She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.

1482
02:19:51,174 --> 02:19:55,469
And then who should find it but you?

1483
02:19:55,678 --> 02:19:58,764
The very person I was most anxious to meet.

1484
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:01,433
And why did you want to meet me?

1485
02:20:01,809 --> 02:20:05,228
I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could.

1486
02:20:05,396 --> 02:20:08,648
So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1487
02:20:08,816 --> 02:20:11,985
- ... to gain your trust. - Hagrid's my friend.

1488
02:20:12,904 --> 02:20:17,491
- And you framed him, didn't you? - It was my word against Hagrid's.

1489
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:20,952
Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.

1490
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,288
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.

1491
02:20:23,456 --> 02:20:26,917
He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.

1492
02:20:27,085 --> 02:20:30,420
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school...

1493
02:20:30,588 --> 02:20:32,422
...so I decided to leave behind a diary...

1494
02:20:32,590 --> 02:20:34,674
...preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages...

1495
02:20:34,842 --> 02:20:37,511
...so that one day I would be able to lead another...

1496
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:40,514
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.

1497
02:20:40,723 --> 02:20:42,933
Well, you haven't finished it this time.

1498
02:20:43,101 --> 02:20:46,103
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready.

1499
02:20:46,270 --> 02:20:48,980
And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.

1500
02:20:49,357 --> 02:20:54,611
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.

1501
02:20:54,862 --> 02:20:59,658
For many months now, my new target has been you.

1502
02:21:01,119 --> 02:21:04,746
How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent...

1503
02:21:04,914 --> 02:21:07,541
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?

1504
02:21:07,875 --> 02:21:10,836
How did you escape with nothing but a scar...

1505
02:21:11,003 --> 02:21:13,380
...while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?

1506
02:21:13,548 --> 02:21:17,759
Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.

1507
02:21:17,927 --> 02:21:24,391
Voldemort is my past, present and future.

1508
02:21:44,829 --> 02:21:48,290
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1509
02:21:51,419 --> 02:21:55,005
- You're Voldemort. - Surely you didn't think...

1510
02:21:55,173 --> 02:21:59,676
...I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?

1511
02:21:59,844 --> 02:22:04,014
No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1512
02:22:04,182 --> 02:22:08,393
...would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1513
02:22:08,561 --> 02:22:11,730
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1514
02:22:11,898 --> 02:22:15,317
Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.

1515
02:22:15,526 --> 02:22:20,530
He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.

1516
02:22:26,913 --> 02:22:27,954
Fawkes?

1517
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:47,807
So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.

1518
02:22:47,975 --> 02:22:51,645
A songbird and an old hat.

1519
02:23:04,951 --> 02:23:09,496
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1520
02:23:09,664 --> 02:23:13,667
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1521
02:23:27,014 --> 02:23:31,393
Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me.

1522
02:24:01,549 --> 02:24:03,133
RIDDLE: No!

1523
02:24:03,551 --> 02:24:08,054
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you.

1524
02:25:50,074 --> 02:25:53,326
Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete.

1525
02:25:53,536 --> 02:25:58,415
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1526
02:25:58,582 --> 02:26:01,251
Lord Voldemort will return...

1527
02:26:01,627 --> 02:26:05,839
...very much alive.

1528
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:07,966
Ginny?

1529
02:28:24,311 --> 02:28:25,895
RIDDLE: Remarkable, isn't it...

1530
02:28:26,063 --> 02:28:30,066
...how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1531
02:28:30,234 --> 02:28:32,902
I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.

1532
02:28:33,237 --> 02:28:37,282
You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1533
02:28:42,288 --> 02:28:45,957
Funny, the damage a silly little book can do...

1534
02:28:46,125 --> 02:28:51,212
...especially in the hands of a silly little girl.

1535
02:28:54,008 --> 02:28:55,842
What are you doing?

1536
02:28:58,721 --> 02:29:00,805
Stop. No!

1537
02:29:53,484 --> 02:29:55,401
Ginny.

1538
02:29:57,154 --> 02:29:58,905
Harry.

1539
02:29:59,073 --> 02:30:03,076
It was me. But I swear, I didn't mean to.

1540
02:30:03,285 --> 02:30:06,788
Riddle made me, and...

1541
02:30:07,289 --> 02:30:09,916
Harry, you're hurt.

1542
02:30:10,292 --> 02:30:11,751
Don't worry.

1543
02:30:11,919 --> 02:30:15,588
Ginny, you need to get yourself out.

1544
02:30:15,798 --> 02:30:19,008
Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.

1545
02:30:31,188 --> 02:30:33,314
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1546
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:36,859
I just wasn't quick enough.

1547
02:30:57,631 --> 02:30:59,382
Of course.

1548
02:30:59,633 --> 02:31:02,468
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1549
02:31:04,096 --> 02:31:05,888
Thanks.

1550
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:09,767
It's all right, Ginny.

1551
02:31:10,894 --> 02:31:13,104
It's over.

1552
02:31:14,106 --> 02:31:16,649
It's just a memory.

1553
02:31:19,570 --> 02:31:24,907
Amazing! This is just like magic!

1554
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:38,838
DUMBLEDORE: You both realize, of course...

1555
02:31:39,006 --> 02:31:44,510
...that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1556
02:31:45,137 --> 02:31:46,179
Yes, sir.

1557
02:31:46,388 --> 02:31:49,599
There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.

1558
02:31:49,767 --> 02:31:50,933
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1559
02:31:51,101 --> 02:31:53,895
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1560
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:57,690
...that you both receive...

1561
02:31:58,192 --> 02:32:02,278
...Special Awards for Services to the School.

1562
02:32:04,406 --> 02:32:06,199
Thanks, sir.

1563
02:32:06,784 --> 02:32:09,118
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1564
02:32:09,286 --> 02:32:13,456
...have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.

1565
02:32:14,541 --> 02:32:19,295
I believe we want our gamekeeper back.

1566
02:32:22,007 --> 02:32:23,966
Harry.

1567
02:32:24,301 --> 02:32:28,638
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1568
02:32:29,223 --> 02:32:32,725
You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1569
02:32:33,644 --> 02:32:38,189
Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.

1570
02:32:40,567 --> 02:32:42,151
And...

1571
02:32:42,694 --> 02:32:44,153
...second...

1572
02:32:44,321 --> 02:32:49,075
...I sense that something is troubling you.

1573
02:32:49,326 --> 02:32:51,828
Am I right, Harry?

1574
02:32:53,664 --> 02:32:55,373
It's just...

1575
02:32:56,542 --> 02:33:01,254
You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain...

1576
02:33:01,463 --> 02:33:07,093
Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.

1577
02:33:07,678 --> 02:33:08,845
I see.

1578
02:33:09,012 --> 02:33:14,851
Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1579
02:33:15,269 --> 02:33:20,773
Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.

1580
02:33:22,025 --> 02:33:24,735
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1581
02:33:25,112 --> 02:33:28,948
...he transferred some of his powers to you...

1582
02:33:29,116 --> 02:33:32,076
...the night he gave you that scar.

1583
02:33:32,244 --> 02:33:36,122
Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?

1584
02:33:36,373 --> 02:33:37,874
Uh-huh.

1585
02:33:38,041 --> 02:33:40,751
Not intentionally...

1586
02:33:41,628 --> 02:33:43,546
...but yes.

1587
02:33:45,507 --> 02:33:48,801
So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be in Slytherin.

1588
02:33:49,011 --> 02:33:53,806
It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1589
02:33:54,016 --> 02:33:56,809
Determination, resourcefulness...

1590
02:33:57,019 --> 02:34:01,022
...and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules.

1591
02:34:01,732 --> 02:34:05,735
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?

1592
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:10,239
- Because I asked it to. - Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1593
02:34:10,407 --> 02:34:12,450
Which makes you different from Voldemort.

1594
02:34:12,618 --> 02:34:16,537
It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.

1595
02:34:16,788 --> 02:34:18,915
It is our choices.

1596
02:34:22,586 --> 02:34:26,005
If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor...

1597
02:34:26,173 --> 02:34:31,093
...then I suggest you look more closely at this.

1598
02:34:32,095 --> 02:34:33,763
Be careful.

1599
02:34:39,436 --> 02:34:42,104
Godric Gryffindor.

1600
02:34:42,272 --> 02:34:46,317
It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.

1601
02:34:55,202 --> 02:34:56,619
HARRY: Dobby.

1602
02:34:57,871 --> 02:35:02,291
So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1603
02:35:04,461 --> 02:35:07,797
I'll deal with you later.

1604
02:35:13,637 --> 02:35:15,221
LUCIUS: Out of my way, Potter.

1605
02:35:15,389 --> 02:35:18,975
So it's true. You have returned.

1606
02:35:19,643 --> 02:35:22,478
When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1607
02:35:22,646 --> 02:35:26,816
...was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.

1608
02:35:27,651 --> 02:35:28,985
Ridiculous.

1609
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:31,654
DUMBLEDORE: Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1610
02:35:31,863 --> 02:35:35,533
...were under the impression that you would curse their families...

1611
02:35:35,701 --> 02:35:38,536
...if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.

1612
02:35:38,996 --> 02:35:42,498
- How dare you! - Beg your pardon?

1613
02:35:42,666 --> 02:35:46,419
My sole concern has always been and will always be...

1614
02:35:46,628 --> 02:35:49,422
...the welfare of this school...

1615
02:35:49,631 --> 02:35:53,884
...and, of course, its students.

1616
02:35:57,931 --> 02:36:02,184
The culprit has been identified, I presume?

1617
02:36:02,519 --> 02:36:04,061
Oh, yes.

1618
02:36:05,689 --> 02:36:07,523
And?

1619
02:36:08,692 --> 02:36:10,693
Who was it?

1620
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:20,536
- Voldemort. - Ah.

1621
02:36:20,871 --> 02:36:26,292
Only this time he chose to act through somebody else...

1622
02:36:26,877 --> 02:36:30,463
...by means of this.

1623
02:36:33,175 --> 02:36:34,717
I see.

1624
02:36:36,178 --> 02:36:40,389
DUMBLEDORE: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it.

1625
02:36:40,724 --> 02:36:44,393
One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things...

1626
02:36:44,561 --> 02:36:47,772
...should find their way into innocent hands.

1627
02:36:48,106 --> 02:36:52,068
The consequences for the one responsible would be...

1628
02:36:52,402 --> 02:36:54,278
...severe.

1629
02:36:55,739 --> 02:36:58,491
Well, let us hope...

1630
02:36:58,700 --> 02:37:04,246
...that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.

1631
02:37:04,956 --> 02:37:08,751
Don't worry. I will be.

1632
02:37:17,469 --> 02:37:19,512
Dumbledore.

1633
02:37:20,639 --> 02:37:24,225
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1634
02:37:41,451 --> 02:37:45,955
Sir? I wonder if I could have that?

1635
02:37:52,337 --> 02:37:53,963
HARRY: Mr. Malfoy.

1636
02:37:54,131 --> 02:37:56,298
Mr. Malfoy!

1637
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:58,968
I have something of yours.

1638
02:38:00,637 --> 02:38:03,556
Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.

1639
02:38:03,765 --> 02:38:05,307
Oh, I think you do, sir.

1640
02:38:05,475 --> 02:38:08,561
I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1641
02:38:08,770 --> 02:38:10,146
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1642
02:38:10,856 --> 02:38:13,399
You do, do you?

1643
02:38:20,782 --> 02:38:23,826
Why don't you prove it?

1644
02:38:30,083 --> 02:38:32,293
Come, Dobby.

1645
02:38:33,545 --> 02:38:35,588
Open it.

1646
02:38:39,092 --> 02:38:40,676
Dobby.

1647
02:38:40,844 --> 02:38:44,013
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1648
02:38:44,306 --> 02:38:46,348
What? I didn't give-

1649
02:38:46,516 --> 02:38:50,227
Master has presented Dobby with clothes.

1650
02:38:50,395 --> 02:38:53,439
Dobby is free.

1651
02:39:00,030 --> 02:39:03,741
You lost me my servant!

1652
02:39:10,707 --> 02:39:14,710
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1653
02:39:23,762 --> 02:39:24,845
Hm.

1654
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:30,559
Your parents were meddlesome fools too.

1655
02:39:30,727 --> 02:39:33,896
Mark my words, Potter. One day soon...

1656
02:39:34,064 --> 02:39:39,276
...you are going to meet the same sticky end.

1657
02:39:44,991 --> 02:39:50,913
Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him?

1658
02:39:51,248 --> 02:39:55,501
- Just promise me something. - Anything, sir.

1659
02:39:57,462 --> 02:39:59,922
Never try to save my life again.

1660
02:40:06,096 --> 02:40:09,098
GIRL 1: Welcome back, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you.

1661
02:40:09,391 --> 02:40:11,767
GIRL 2: Good evening, Sir Nicholas. - Good evening.

1662
02:40:11,935 --> 02:40:14,812
BOY: Good to see you, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you.

1663
02:40:16,189 --> 02:40:18,440
Hello.

1664
02:40:20,110 --> 02:40:24,780
- Hermione! Welcome back. - Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1665
02:40:27,993 --> 02:40:31,328
Harry. It's Hermione.

1666
02:40:52,684 --> 02:40:57,313
Uh, um, ahem.

1667
02:40:58,148 --> 02:41:01,859
- Welcome back, Hermione. - It's good to be back.

1668
02:41:02,027 --> 02:41:04,653
Congratulations. I can't believe you solved it.

1669
02:41:04,821 --> 02:41:07,031
We had loads of help from you.

1670
02:41:07,198 --> 02:41:10,409
- We couldn't have done it without you. - Thanks.

1671
02:41:12,245 --> 02:41:15,205
Could I have your attention, please?

1672
02:41:19,377 --> 02:41:21,879
Before we begin the feast...

1673
02:41:22,047 --> 02:41:28,344
...let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1674
02:41:28,511 --> 02:41:32,598
...whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered...

1675
02:41:32,766 --> 02:41:35,476
...to all who had been Petrified.

1676
02:41:45,987 --> 02:41:48,947
Also, in light of the recent events...

1677
02:41:49,115 --> 02:41:51,283
...as a school treat...

1678
02:41:51,493 --> 02:41:55,412
...all exams have been canceled.

1679
02:41:58,083 --> 02:41:59,708
Oh, no.

1680
02:42:16,601 --> 02:42:18,644
Sorry I'm late.

1681
02:42:24,734 --> 02:42:29,113
The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.

1682
02:42:29,447 --> 02:42:32,741
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1683
02:42:48,550 --> 02:42:54,555
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron...

1684
02:42:54,764 --> 02:42:57,683
...and Hermione, of course...

1685
02:42:58,351 --> 02:43:02,438
...I would still be you-know-where...

1686
02:43:02,605 --> 02:43:06,191
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1687
02:43:15,618 --> 02:43:18,579
There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
