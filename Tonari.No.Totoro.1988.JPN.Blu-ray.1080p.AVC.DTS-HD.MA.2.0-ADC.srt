00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,821
Dad, do you want a caramel?

11
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,741
Thanks.
Aren't you tired?

12
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,575
All right.

13
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:38,868
We're almost there.

14
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,381
Mei, hide!

15
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,222
It wasn't a policeman.

16
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,757
Hello.
Are your parents around?

17
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,094
Thanks.

18
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:44,183
I'm Kusakabe!
We've just arrived!

19
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,186
A pleasure to meet you!

20
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,980
Welcome!

21
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,820
Thank you.

22
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:18,468
Here we are!

23
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,637
Wait!

24
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,975
Mei, there's a bridge!

25
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,310
A bridge?

26
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,734
See that flash?
Fish too!

27
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,236
So, you like it here?

28
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,033
Dad, it's terrific!

29
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,868
Look, a tunnel of trees!

30
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,539
Is that our house?

31
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,253
Come on!

32
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,185
It's a wreck!

33
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,728
Wreck!

34
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,355
Looks like a haunted house!

35
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,356
Haunted?

36
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,365
And it's all rotten!

37
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,628
It's gonna fall down!

38
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,547
Fall down!

39
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,183
Look, Mei!

40
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,895
See?

41
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,739
It's huge.

42
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,831
Dad, there's a huge tree!

43
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,417
It's a camphor tree.

44
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,421
- Camphor tree.
- Camphor tree.

45
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,598
Oops!

46
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,143
An acorn!

47
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,771
Show me.

48
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:38,774
Another one!

49
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,282
One for me!

50
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,832
Out of the way.
I can't open the screens.

51
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,500
Acorns!

52
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,961
There's acorns in the house.

53
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,630
They dropped from up there!

54
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,137
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

55
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,056
Squirrels, really?

56
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,975
Or rats that like acorns.

57
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,645
I'd rather have squirrels!

58
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,147
Where shall I put this?

59
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:23,319
Here, I'll get the door for you.
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

60
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,529
It's just round the back.

61
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,158
Mei, come on!

62
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,161
Wait for me!

63
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,247
Hurry!

64
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,412
Ready?

65
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,134
Bathtubs.

66
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,516
There's nothing here.

67
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:38,894
That's the bathroom.

68
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,813
Dad, there's something in here.

69
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:41,731
A squirrel?

70
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:46,652
Dunno. A bunch of black things
but not roaches or mice.

71
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,446
Really?

72
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,208
Can you see 'em?

73
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,295
I think they were... Dustbunnies.

74
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,298
"Dustbunnies"
Like in my picture book?

75
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,885
That's right.
Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

76
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,642
When you walk into a dark room
from outside,...

77
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,771
...your eyes dim and
so the dustbunnies come out.

78
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,314
Oh, I see.

79
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:30,446
Come here, dustbunnies.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

80
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:40,331
Let's get to work! See if you can find
how to get upstairs.

81
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,919
Get up there and open
all the windows.

82
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,295
Sure!

83
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,963
I'm coming, too!

84
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,099
Toilet!

85
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,560
Not here!

86
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,204
Nothing here!

87
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,331
Nothing!

88
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,260
Mei, it's here!

89
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,476
It's pitch black!

90
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,353
Dustbunnies.

91
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,946
Another acorn.

92
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:04,039
Come out, dustbunnies!

93
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,166
Are you there, Mr. Dustbunny?

94
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,654
Dad, there's definitely something here!

95
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:22,952
That's exciting! I've always
wanted to live in a haunted house.

96
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,248
I'm coming!

97
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,004
I got it.
Satsuki!

98
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,601
Mei.

99
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,156
You're full of energy!

100
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:46,910
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after
the house and came to help.

101
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,873
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

102
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,792
Nice to meet you both.

103
00:13:53,917 --> 00:14:00,341
I'd have cleaned up
if I'd known you'd be this quick.

104
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,718
No, you've done plenty.

105
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:08,265
Lately I've been so busy in the rice
paddies, I only did a bit of dusting.

106
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,353
What have you done to your hands?

107
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,730
The dustbunny got away.

108
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,774
Your feet, too!

109
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,905
Mine are black, too!

110
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,124
That must be the 'soot spreaders'.

111
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:40,506
Those little, black,
fuzzy things that fly?

112
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:45,260
That's right.
They breed in empty old houses,...

113
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:49,056
...and cover them with soot and dust.

114
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:57,523
I could see them when I was little.
Now you can too, huh?

115
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,274
Are they like goblins or something?

116
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,737
Naah, nothing so scary.

117
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:09,243
If you keep smiling,
they'll soon leave the house.

118
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:15,124
They're probably deciding
where to go next, right now.

119
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,714
Mei, they're going away.

120
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,715
That's no fun.

121
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,427
What happens if a huge one
comes out, like this?

122
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,137
I wouldn't be scared.

123
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,141
Okay then, I won't walk you to
the bathroom at night.

124
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:39,481
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get
some water from the stream?

125
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,649
From the stream?

126
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,984
I'm coming, too!

127
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,322
Mei, wait there.

128
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,667
Did you get a fish?

129
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,222
Nanny, it's coming out!

130
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:17,227
Good, keep pumping
'til the water gets cold.

131
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,021
Okay!

132
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,899
May I help you?

133
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,903
Huh... My Mom... For Granny.

134
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,114
Yes?

135
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,914
Wait, what is it?

136
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,708
Is that you, Kanta?

137
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:28,715
You live in a haunted house!

138
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,217
Kanta, stop it!

139
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,063
I did the same when I was his age.

140
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:48,694
I hate boys.
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

141
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,238
Eat as much as you want.

142
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,407
Thank you!

143
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,245
Thank you very much for your help.

144
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,748
Good bye!

145
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,368
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

146
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,539
I hope not,
we've only just moved in.

147
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,911
Come on, let's laugh to keep
the bogeymen away!

148
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,915
I'm not scared.

149
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,793
I mean it.
I'm not scared!

150
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,964
One-two, one-two...

151
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,635
Come on, keep up the good work.

152
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,852
Okay! Washing... Finished!

153
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,238
Here we go!

154
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,841
Nanny!

155
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,344
Hello!

156
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,012
Hard at work?

157
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,723
Where're you all heading?

158
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,018
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

159
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:54,856
That's nice.
Give her my regards!

160
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,085
This way.

161
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,904
Hello.

162
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,698
Hello there.

163
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,242
Mommy!

164
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,828
So glad you came, my dear.

165
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,247
Daddy took the wrong road.

166
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,125
Really?
Hello, Satsuki.

167
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,002
It's a school holiday, today.

168
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,461
How nice.

169
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,172
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

170
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,258
It's so good to see you all.

171
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,428
Have you settled into the new house?

172
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,144
A haunted house?

173
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,897
Mom, do you like ghosts?

174
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:20,442
Of course I do!
I can't wait to see them.

175
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,068
See, I told you Mei.

176
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,615
Mei was worried that
you wouldn't like ghosts.

177
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:27,908
What about you two?

178
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:28,950
I love them!

179
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,911
I'm not scared of them!

180
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,957
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

181
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,586
It's really good.
Lucky girl, Mei.

182
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,131
But she always gets mad at me.

183
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,966
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

184
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,093
Come here, Satsuki.

185
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,471
Isn't yours too short?

186
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:50,764
No, I like it like this.

187
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,807
Do mine, Mommy!
Mine, too!

188
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:53,808
Wait your turn!

189
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:59,272
Wavy hair, just like mine
when I was your age.

190
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:03,318
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

191
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:07,489
Probably.
You take after your Mom.

192
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,133
Mom looked really well.

193
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:31,054
You're right. The doctor says
she'll be home soon.

194
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,348
Soon?
Like tomorrow?

195
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,725
You always say this.

196
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,519
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

197
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:41,314
Mom said she'll sleep
with me in my bed.

198
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:45,694
Weren't you saying
you're big enough to sleep alone?

199
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,946
Mom is special!

200
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,929
Dad, time to get up!

201
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,144
Wake up!

202
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,192
Sorry, I overslept again.

203
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,236
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

204
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,572
I totally forgot about it.

205
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,616
It's all right.
I've made something for all of us.

206
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:34,576
It's burning!

207
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,535
I'm coming.

208
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,498
Here, this is yours, Mei.

209
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,667
It's for me?

210
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,045
Mei, sit down and eat!

211
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,257
Here, wrap yours.

212
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,263
Satsuki!

213
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,681
Uh-oh.

214
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,434
I'm coming!

215
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,771
You made a friend already?

216
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,939
She's calling you!

217
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,067
Yup, that's Michiko.

218
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,904
Gotta go!

219
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,990
See ya!

220
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,284
See you later!

221
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,661
Morning!

222
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,955
Hi, let's go.

223
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,928
Daddy!

224
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,639
Do I look all grown up?

225
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,974
Yes dear.
And where might you be going?

226
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,935
I'm just going out.

227
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,376
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

228
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,753
Already?

229
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,434
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

230
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,035
Pole-tads!

231
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,223
Got no bottom.

232
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,738
Gotcha!

233
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,452
Who are you?
A big Dustbunny?

234
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:27,650
To-to-ro?
You're Totoro!

235
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,907
I bet you're Totoro.

236
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:47,688
See you!

237
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:48,939
Okay, catch you later!

238
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,151
I'm home!

239
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,029
Hey there.
Is it that late already?

240
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,114
Where's Mei?
I'm off to Michiko's.

241
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,660
We haven't eaten yet.
Is Mei in the garden?

242
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,538
Mei!

243
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:21,722
Dad, I found her hat!

244
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,332
Wake up, Mei!

245
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,086
You shouldn't sleep here!

246
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,131
Where's Totoro?

247
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,465
Totoro?

248
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,135
Where?

249
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,180
Were you dreaming?

250
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:04,890
Totoro was here.

251
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,102
You mean that troll
in your picture book?

252
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:15,443
Yeah. He was all hairy with
a big mouth like this.

253
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:22,283
There's a tiny one and a little one
and a huge one like this.

254
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:29,582
There you are.
Wow, this is amazing.

255
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,709
A great hiding place!

256
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,254
Dad, Mei said she met a Totoro here.

257
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,505
A Totoro?

258
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:38,299
It's this way.

259
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,350
Hey, wait for me!

260
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:51,645
Huh?!

261
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:54,899
Here?

262
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,317
No.

263
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,069
It went to a big tree.

264
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:01,280
But there wasn't any other path.

265
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,533
Mei!
Come back!

266
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:23,177
But it's true!
Totoro was here.

267
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,012
I'm not lying.

268
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:35,481
I know, Mei.

269
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,650
I didn't lie.

270
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:43,030
Neither of us think you're lying.

271
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:48,994
You probably met the king of this forest.
You were very lucky.

272
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,665
He doesn't come out very often.

273
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,460
We should pay our respects
at the shrine.

274
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,461
Pay our respects?

275
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,213
To this forest.

276
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:18,732
Mei, you're getting heavy.

277
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,568
Daddy, look!
That camphor tree!

278
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:22,945
What a big tree.

279
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,037
It's here!

280
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,707
Is that the tree?

281
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:38,085
Dad, hurry up.

282
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,931
The hole has gone.

283
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,433
Are you sure it was here?

284
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,978
The hole disappeared.

285
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,564
I told you he doesn't come
to see us often.

286
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:01,317
But will he come again?
I want to meet him, too.

287
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:05,029
If you're lucky, sure.

288
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,990
What a beautiful tree.

289
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:13,996
This tree must have stood here
for years and years.

290
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:19,293
Trees and people
used to be good friends.

291
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:27,259
I saw that tree and fell in love with
the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

292
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,679
Okay, let's pay our respects
then get home for lunch.

293
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,307
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

294
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:34,934
I want to go, too!

295
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,310
Attention!

296
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:41,315
Thank you for looking after Mei.

297
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,651
Please take care of us.

298
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:45,486
Let's race home!

299
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,071
That's not fair!
Dad!

300
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,157
Wait!

301
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:53,327
Hurry up!

302
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,663
Wait for me!

303
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,459
<i>Dear Mother, something amazing
happened today.</i>

304
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:04,505
<i>Mei met a giant Totoro.</i>

305
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,973
<i>And I'm hoping to see him
myself soon, too.</i>

306
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,256
Kanta, hurry up!
You'll be late!

307
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,382
Coming.

308
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,217
Mei?

309
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,927
Excuse me!

310
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,471
Yes, Satsuki?

311
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:37,890
It's my sister.

312
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,774
What happened, Nanny?

313
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:51,445
I'm sorry. She insisted that
she be with you.

314
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:56,366
It's Dad's day at the university.

315
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:59,495
You promised to be
a good girl at Nanny's.

316
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:06,794
I still have two more classes
and Nanny's too busy for this.

317
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:12,132
She was good up 'til now,
weren't you?

318
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,683
I'll go talk to my teacher.

319
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:34,988
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital,
I want you all to be nice to her.

320
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,455
What's that?

321
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:44,998
It's Totoro.

322
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:48,502
Mei, you should keep quiet.

323
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:49,670
Okay.

324
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:02,474
<i>Bye bye, Mei!</i>

325
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:04,434
I can't stay after class today.

326
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,478
We'll let teacher know.

327
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,147
See you!

328
00:44:09,857 --> 00:44:11,525
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

329
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:12,693
Okay.

330
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:22,119
Here it comes!

331
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:35,215
Here.

332
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:41,555
I won't cry.
Aren't I good?

333
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,727
It's getting worse...

334
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:52,274
Dear Guardian Spirit,
let us stay until the rain stops.

335
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:37,152
But...

336
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,591
That was lucky.

337
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:02,844
It's got holes in it.

338
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:16,942
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

339
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:18,568
I'm going, too.

340
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:23,865
I said I forgot it!

341
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:27,369
What idiot forgets his umbrella
on a rainy day?

342
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:29,288
Ouch!

343
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,707
You broke it playing, I bet.

344
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,125
I did not!

345
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:47,889
Excuse me.

346
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:53,729
Hello Satsuki.
Hi, Mei. Grandma!

347
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,690
I'm sorry about Mei today.

348
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,692
Not at all.
Sorry we couldn't do more.

349
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,237
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

350
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:06,033
He did?
A broken old thing like that!

351
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,660
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

352
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:12,414
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

353
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:17,419
Not at all. It probably
cleaned him up a little.

354
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,254
Are you off to meet your father?

355
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:20,130
Yes.

356
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,715
What good girls you are.

357
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,217
Bye bye, Mei.

358
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:36,897
Who was that?

359
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:38,023
I don't know.

360
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,529
Just in time!

361
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:58,752
Getting on?

362
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:02,005
All right, drive on.

363
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:12,432
Daddy wasn't on it.

364
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,937
He'll be on the next one.
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

365
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,224
Are you okay?

366
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,050
Sleepy?

367
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:33,847
I told you.
Wanna go to Nanny's?

368
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,809
It won't be much longer.
Hang in there.

369
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,818
It's late.

370
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:55,452
Come on.

371
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,161
Are you Totoro?

372
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,090
Wait a minute.

373
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,180
You can use this.

374
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,601
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

375
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:50,609
Hold it like this.

376
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,770
Here's the bus!

377
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,966
He took Daddy's umbrella.

378
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,522
I'm sorry.

379
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:35,774
All right, drive on.

380
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:39,652
The train was late
and I missed the bus.

381
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:42,030
Were you worried?

382
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,783
We met him, Dad!
He was here!

383
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:46,659
And the cat bus!

384
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,161
What?

385
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,163
It was huge!

386
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:54,167
With big eyes like these!

387
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:59,214
We met him!
We met Totoro!

388
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,549
How wonderful!

389
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,479
Come on, Daddy.

390
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:26,241
<i>Dear Mother, I can't tell you
how excited I was today.</i>

391
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:31,037
<i>It was the scariest, funniest day
I've ever had.</i>

392
00:55:31,204 --> 00:55:33,623
<i>Totoro gave us a lovely present...</i>

393
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:38,211
<i>...wrapped in bamboo leaves and
tied with dragon whiskers.</i>

394
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:43,383
<i>When we opened it,
it was full of magic nuts and seeds!</i>

395
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:54,143
"We decided to plant them in the garden
to make a lovely forest."

396
00:55:54,269 --> 00:56:00,984
<i>But they haven't sprouted yet.
Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.</i>

397
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,738
<i>She looks like a little crab.</i>

398
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,537
<i>It's nearly summer vacation.</i>

399
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:16,958
<i>Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon.
Love, Satsuki.</i>

400
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:22,380
Come on.
Bed time.

401
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:27,260
Lights off!

402
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,887
Wait, Dad.

403
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:32,098
Daddy, do you think they will
sprout tomorrow?

404
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:37,520
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.
Night night.

405
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:27,737
Mei!

406
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:47,548
That's where we planted the seeds.

407
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:22,185
Wow, we did it!

408
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,388
We're the wind!

409
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:42,992
There are no trees!

410
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:49,582
Yessss!

411
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:53,794
It was a dream.

412
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,214
But it wasn't a dream.

413
01:01:57,632 --> 01:02:00,885
We did it!

414
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:22,949
Mr. Kusakabe!
Telegram!

415
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,121
Anyone home?

416
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:38,172
Nanny.

417
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,803
I'm here.

418
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,807
This one is ripe.

419
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:58,401
What about this one?

420
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:00,027
That's good, too.

421
01:03:06,242 --> 01:03:09,453
Your garden's a treasure house.

422
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,498
Let's take a little break.

423
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:21,299
These should be cold now.

424
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:23,301
Looks delicious.

425
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,020
So good.

426
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:40,026
The sun blessed these so
they're really good for you.

427
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:42,320
Would they help my Mom, too?

428
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:47,366
Of course. If she eats my vegetables,
she'll get better right away.

429
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:50,411
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

430
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:52,580
She'll sleep in my bed!

431
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:56,042
At last.
That's wonderful.

432
01:03:56,208 --> 01:04:02,548
But it's only for a couple of days.
To get used to the new house.

433
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:07,178
I see. We'll feed her
lots of vegetables, then.

434
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,723
I'll give her this corn I picked.

435
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:12,892
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

436
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,727
Yes!

437
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,487
There was a telegram for you.

438
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:25,529
For us?

439
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:32,078
Dad won't be back till late,
what shall I do?

440
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:35,081
Open it, it might be important.

441
01:04:39,085 --> 01:04:42,797
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL...

442
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:48,302
It's from Mom's hospital!
Somethings happened to her!

443
01:04:50,513 --> 01:04:52,598
Nanny!
What shall I do?

444
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:56,769
Calm down.
Do you know where your Dad is?

445
01:04:56,936 --> 01:05:00,147
I know his office number,
but we don't have a telephone.

446
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:04,485
Kanta, take her to use the phone
in the main house!

447
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:12,701
Mei, stay here with me!

448
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,629
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

449
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:04,003
Hello, I'd like to make a
long-distance call, please.

450
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:09,383
It's Tokyo 31-1382.

451
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,888
A cute girl, Kanta.

452
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:18,809
Hello?
Yes?

453
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:24,899
Hello, may I speak to Dad...
Er... Mr. Kusakabe?

454
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:27,693
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

455
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,699
Daddy?
It's me, Satsuki!

456
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:39,705
Hello, what's up?
From the hospital?

457
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:42,583
<i>Okay, I'll call them right away.</i>

458
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:45,586
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

459
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:52,176
<i>Don't worry.
I'll check and call you right back.</i>

460
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,346
I'm hanging up now, stay there.

461
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:01,352
May I stay here until he calls back?

462
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:04,063
Stay as long as you like.

463
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,572
Satsuki!

464
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:25,251
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

465
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:30,256
No, it's my Mom's!

466
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:52,486
Listen Mei. Mom's not well
so she's not coming home this time.

467
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:54,071
No!

468
01:07:55,364 --> 01:07:58,951
There's nothing we can do.
You don't want her to get worse, do you?

469
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:00,744
No!

470
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:04,164
It's just for a few more days.

471
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:09,461
So you don't care
if she dies, do you?

472
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,425
Stop being silly!
I'm going.

473
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:26,478
Let's go, Mei.

474
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:33,652
I hate you, Satsuki!

475
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:04,099
We should bring the washing in.

476
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:11,565
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

477
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:19,573
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital
to check on her.

478
01:09:20,282 --> 01:09:26,997
Besides, it's just a cold,
she'll be back next week.

479
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:35,214
They said it was just a cold...

480
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,841
...when she went into hospital.

481
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:41,345
But what if she dies!

482
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:43,347
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

483
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:46,183
Maybe Mom will...

484
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:56,694
Stop it. Nobody would leave
two pretty little girls like you.

485
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:01,365
There, there.
Don't cry.

486
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:06,203
I'll be here until Daddy
comes back, okay?

487
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:51,248
Mei!

488
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:06,638
Did she come back?

489
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:09,266
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

490
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:13,645
That's strange.
Where has she gone?

491
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:17,608
I was nasty to her,
'cause she was being silly...

492
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:20,652
Maybe she's heading for
the hospital!

493
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:26,742
The hospital? It would take
a grown-up three hours!

494
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:27,659
I'll go look!

495
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:36,293
Kanta, hurry!
Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

496
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,055
Stupid Mei.
Always getting lost.

497
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,157
Excuse me.

498
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:13,539
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
She's my sister.

499
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:19,044
No, I don't think so.
I'm sure I would've noticed.

500
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:21,839
Maybe she wasn't here.

501
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,277
Are you sure she came this way?

502
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:45,070
I don't know.

503
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,645
Please, stop!

504
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:22,441
Jerk!
What are you doing?!

505
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:25,444
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl?

506
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:27,321
Your little sister?

507
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:31,325
She's four.
I think she's heading to the hospital.

508
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,285
Did you see anyone?

509
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:38,832
No. We just came from there,
but we didn't see anyone.

510
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,752
Thanks anyway.

511
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,463
Where have you come from?

512
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,006
From Matsugo.

513
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,259
Really?

514
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,054
Good luck.

515
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:04,942
Satsuki!

516
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:08,695
<i>Kanta!</i>

517
01:14:09,488 --> 01:14:10,322
Find her?

518
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:12,157
No. And you?

519
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:17,287
Dad and the others are looking
for her. I'll go to the hospital,...

520
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:19,122
...you go back home.

521
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:23,210
I guess she got lost
on the way to the hospital.

522
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:26,505
They found a sandal by the pond.

523
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,640
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

524
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,367
Did you find her?

525
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:31,069
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

526
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:33,822
It's too deep here,
better search further away!

527
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,074
Hey, are there any poles left?

528
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,960
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

529
01:15:51,757 --> 01:15:53,383
Nanny!

530
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:56,428
Look, is it hers?

531
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:06,646
No, it isn't.

532
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:22,996
Thank heavens,
I was sure it was hers.

533
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:25,957
Hey, Nanny was
jumping to conclusions.

534
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,459
It's not hers!

535
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:29,586
Where's she gone then?

536
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:31,171
Let's start from scratch.

537
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:32,923
We better hurry,
it'll be dark soon.

538
01:16:33,048 --> 01:16:36,802
I really appreciate
your help, everyone.

539
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,012
Don't worry.
Could have been any of us.

540
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:10,001
Please, help me Totoro!

541
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:16,007
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon.
I'm sure she's scared somewhere.

542
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:47,956
Totoro!

543
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:53,879
Mei is lost
and we can't find her!

544
01:17:54,421 --> 01:17:59,885
She must be scared,
please help me find her.

545
01:18:01,178 --> 01:18:03,680
I don't know what to do.

546
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:03,990
They can't see the bus.

The trees are moving out of the way!

552
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:08,573
Satsuki!

553
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,255
Mei!

554
01:21:29,052 --> 01:21:30,053
You silly girl.

555
01:21:30,178 --> 01:21:32,180
I'm sorry.

556
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:37,936
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

557
01:21:45,652 --> 01:21:48,238
HOSPITAL

558
01:21:49,948 --> 01:21:51,991
Will you take us to the hospital?

559
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:55,954
Thank you so much.

560
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:09,509
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send
a telegram just for a cold.

561
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:14,305
The girls must be worried.
I'm sorry to upset them.

562
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,225
They'll be fine.
As long as you're okay.

563
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:22,439
We've all learned to cope.
This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

564
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:27,485
They've put up with it so well.

565
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:30,655
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki,
she's been so patient.

566
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:32,949
You're right.

567
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:37,704
I'm going to spoil them
for a while when I come home.

568
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:38,788
Oh no!

569
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:48,131
She's laughing!

570
01:22:48,256 --> 01:22:50,008
Looks like she's fine.

571
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:01,227
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

572
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:04,063
Look.

573
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,863
Where did that come from?

574
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:14,699
What?

575
01:23:15,492 --> 01:23:19,037
I could swear I just saw Satsuki
and Mei laughing up in that tree.

576
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:24,083
Maybe they were too. Look.
